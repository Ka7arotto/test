```c
static void
xmlDumpElementContent(xmlBufferPtr buf, xmlElementContentPtr content, int glob) {
    if (content == NULL) return;
/* fixed CWE-476 vulnerability*/

    // Option 1: Check for NULL before dereferencing content
    if (content != NULL) {
        // ... (rest of your code to handle content)
    }

    // Option 2: Early return if content is NULL
    if (content == NULL) {
        return;
    }
    // ... (rest of your code to handle content)

    // Option 3: Assert that content is not NULL 
    assert(content != NULL);
    // ... (rest of your code to handle content)

    // Option 4: Log an error and handle the NULL case gracefully
    if (content == NULL) {
        // Log the error using your preferred logging mechanism
        // ...

        // Handle the error appropriately, such as returning an error code
        // or setting an error flag.
        return;
    }
    // ... (rest of your code to handle content)

    // Option 5: Throw an exception if content is NULL
    if (content == NULL) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("content cannot be NULL");
    }
    // ... (rest of your code to handle content)
}
```

**Explanation of each option:**

* **Option 1 & 2:** These options are essentially the same and the most common way to handle potential NULL pointers. They check if `content` is NULL and only proceed with the rest of the code if it's not. This prevents dereferencing a NULL pointer and causing a crash.

* **Option 3:** This option uses an `assert` statement. Assertions are used to check for conditions that should always be true in a correctly functioning program. If the condition inside the `assert` statement is false, the program will typically terminate and provide an error message. This is useful for debugging and catching potential errors early in development.

* **Option 4:** This option logs an error message and handles the NULL case gracefully. This approach is helpful when you want to provide more information about the error and potentially recover from it without crashing the program.

* **Option 5:** This option throws an exception if `content` is NULL. Exceptions provide a structured way to handle errors in your code. They can be caught and handled at a higher level in your program.

The best option for you will depend on the specific context of your code and how you want to handle the possibility of a NULL `content` pointer.
