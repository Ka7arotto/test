Please provide me with the code snippet you want to complete. I need the context of the code to give you relevant and helpful code completion suggestions.

For example, provide me with the following:

* **The code snippet:**  The part of the code where you need help.
* **The CWE-787 vulnerability:** What specifically is the vulnerability? 
* **The programming language:** What language is the code written in?

Once you provide me with this information, I can give you five possible code completions that address the CWE-787 vulnerability.
