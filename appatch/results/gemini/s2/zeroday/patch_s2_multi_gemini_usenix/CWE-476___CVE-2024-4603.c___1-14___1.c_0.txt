Please provide me with the code snippet that has the CWE-476 vulnerability so I can provide five possible code completions to fix it. 

**CWE-476** is a vulnerability related to **"NULL Pointer Dereference."** This means that the code is trying to access a memory location that is not valid. 

Here are some general approaches to fix such vulnerabilities:

**1. Check for Null Before Access:**

```c++
// Original code:
if (ptr != NULL) {
  // Do something with ptr
}

// Corrected code:
if (ptr != nullptr) {
  // Do something with ptr
}
```

**2. Use Default Values:**

```c++
// Original code:
int* ptr = NULL;
*ptr = 5; // This could cause a crash

// Corrected code:
int* ptr = new int(0); 
// Or:
int* ptr = nullptr;
if (ptr) {
  *ptr = 5; 
}
```

**3. Handle Exceptions:**

```c++
// Original code:
try {
  // Access pointer
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
  // Handle the exception
}

// Corrected code:
try {
  // Access pointer
} catch (const std::bad_alloc& e) {
  // Handle memory allocation error
} catch (...) {
  // Handle other exceptions
}
```

**4. Use Smart Pointers:**

```c++
// Original code:
int* ptr = new int(5);
// ...
delete ptr; // This might be forgotten

// Corrected code:
std::unique_ptr<int> ptr(new int(5));
// ... // no need to delete explicitly
```

**5. Use a safe alternative:**

```c++
// Original code:
char* buffer = new char[size];
// ...
buffer[index] = value;

// Corrected code:
std::vector<char> buffer(size);
// ...
buffer[index] = value;
```

Please provide the specific code with the CWE-476 vulnerability, and I'll be able to give you more tailored code completions.
