Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the `cfs_time_t` type may not be large enough to hold the result of adding `cfs_time_current_sec()` and `LST_PING_INTERVAL`. If the sum of these two values exceeds the maximum value that `cfs_time_t` can hold, it may result in an integer overflow or wraparound vulnerability.
