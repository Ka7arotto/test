Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because `free` is called on `mp[part]` without checking if `mp` itself is NULL or if `mp[part]` is NULL. If `mp` or `mp[part]` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `free` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
