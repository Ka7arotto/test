**Root Cause Analysis:** The code is vulnerable to a CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds write) because the `buf` array may not have enough space to store the data read from the file. This can happen if the `bufsize` variable is larger than the size of the `buf` array. In this case, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability can occur when `sc_read_binary` writes more data than the size of the `buf` array, which is CWE-787.
