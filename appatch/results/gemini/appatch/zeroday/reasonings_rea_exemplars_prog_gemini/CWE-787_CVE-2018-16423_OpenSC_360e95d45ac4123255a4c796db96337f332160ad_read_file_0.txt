A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is used to reallocate memory for the `*data` pointer without checking if the reallocation was successful. If the reallocation fails, the `*data` pointer will be set to `NULL`, and the subsequent use of the `*data` pointer in the following lines will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
