A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `asctime` function is being called with the `tm` pointer as an argument without first checking if `tm` is NULL. If `tm` is NULL, dereferencing it to access its members will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.

The vulnerable code should be corrected as follows:

```
1 char *my_asctime(time_t t)
3     struct tm *tm;
4     char *str;
6     tm = localtime(&t);
7     if (tm == NULL) {
8         return NULL;  // Handle the NULL case appropriately
9     }
10    str = g_strdup(asctime(tm));
```
