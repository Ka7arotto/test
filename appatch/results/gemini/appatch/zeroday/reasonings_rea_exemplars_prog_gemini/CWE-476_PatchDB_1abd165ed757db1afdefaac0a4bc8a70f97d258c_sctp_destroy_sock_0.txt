A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it is accessing the `sp->do_auto_asconf` field without first checking if `sp` is NULL. If `sp` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `do_auto_asconf` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
