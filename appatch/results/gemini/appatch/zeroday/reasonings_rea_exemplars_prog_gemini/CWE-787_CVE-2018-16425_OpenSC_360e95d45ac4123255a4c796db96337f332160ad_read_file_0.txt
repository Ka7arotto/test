A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `data` pointer, but the size of the memory is not checked before the allocation. This can lead to allocating more memory than is available, which can cause a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
