A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it is assigning the result of a function call (`strchr`) to a pointer (`mask_str`) without first checking if the function call was successful. If the `strchr` function returns NULL, assigning it to `mask_str` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
