**Root Cause Analysis:** Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `vps_id` variable is used to access the `hevc->sps[sps_id]` array without doing a bounds check. If `sps_id` is negative or greater than or equal to 16, it may lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
