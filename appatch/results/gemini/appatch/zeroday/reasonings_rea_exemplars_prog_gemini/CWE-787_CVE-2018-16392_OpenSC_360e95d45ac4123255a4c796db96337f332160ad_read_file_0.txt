A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is attempting to resize the `*data` pointer to the `len` size without checking if `*data` is `NULL`. If `*data` is `NULL`, then `realloc` will try to allocate memory at an invalid address, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write and a subsequent crash.
