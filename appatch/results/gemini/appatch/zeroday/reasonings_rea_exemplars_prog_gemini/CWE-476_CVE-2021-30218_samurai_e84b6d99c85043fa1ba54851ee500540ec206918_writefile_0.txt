A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `f` pointer is used for file writing even though there is no check for its successful creation at line 6. If `fopen` fails at line 6 and returns NULL, `f` will be NULL, and using it for file writing operations in line 12 will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which can cause a crash or undefined behavior.
