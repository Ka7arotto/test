A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for `vi`, but the allocated memory is not checked for NULL. If the memory allocation fails, then `vi` will be a NULL pointer, and accessing it will result in a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
