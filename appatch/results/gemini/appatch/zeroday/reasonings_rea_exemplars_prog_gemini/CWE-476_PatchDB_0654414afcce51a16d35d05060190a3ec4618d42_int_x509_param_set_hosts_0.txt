A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it is calling `memchr(name, '\0', namelen)` to check for the presence of a NULL character in the `name` buffer. However, it is not checking first if `name` itself is NULL, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if `name` is NULL.
