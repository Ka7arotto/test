A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `af` pointer is being used without being checked for NULL. If `af` is NULL, the subsequent call to `af->from_addr_param` at line 102 will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
