A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because `i` is declared as an `int`, which is a signed integer type. When looping through a large number of elements, the value of `i` may exceed the maximum positive value that can be stored in a signed integer, resulting in an integer overflow. This can lead to undefined behavior, such as accessing memory outside the bounds of the array or causing the program to crash.
