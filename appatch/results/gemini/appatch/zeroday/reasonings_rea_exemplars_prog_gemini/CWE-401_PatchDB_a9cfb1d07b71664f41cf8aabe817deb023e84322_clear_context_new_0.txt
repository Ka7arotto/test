A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the `TempBuffer` variable is allocated memory using `malloc` but is not freed in the cleanup block when `clear->nsc` fails to be allocated. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not released before the function returns.
