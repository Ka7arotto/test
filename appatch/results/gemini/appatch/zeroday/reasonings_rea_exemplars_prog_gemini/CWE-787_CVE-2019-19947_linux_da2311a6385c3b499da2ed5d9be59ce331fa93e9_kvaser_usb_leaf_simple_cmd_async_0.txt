Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists because the `cmd` variable is allocated on the heap using `kmalloc` without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, `kmalloc` returns `NULL`, and assigning `NULL` to `cmd` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when dereferencing `cmd` later in the code.
