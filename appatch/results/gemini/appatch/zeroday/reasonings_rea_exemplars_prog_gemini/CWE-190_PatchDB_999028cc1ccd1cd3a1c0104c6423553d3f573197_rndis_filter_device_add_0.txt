A: Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability exists because the variable `t` is declared as an `int` without specifying its signedness (i.e., `int` vs `unsigned int`). This can lead to unexpected behavior if the value assigned to `t` is outside the expected range of an `int`. For example, if a negative value is assigned to `t`, it may result in undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.
