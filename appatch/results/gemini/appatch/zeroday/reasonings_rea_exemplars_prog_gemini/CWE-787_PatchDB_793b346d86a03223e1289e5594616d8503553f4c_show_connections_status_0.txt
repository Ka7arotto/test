Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because `count` may be 0 at the time of the memory allocation for `array`, resulting in a memory allocation failure and potentially causing an out-of-bounds write error. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential system compromise.
