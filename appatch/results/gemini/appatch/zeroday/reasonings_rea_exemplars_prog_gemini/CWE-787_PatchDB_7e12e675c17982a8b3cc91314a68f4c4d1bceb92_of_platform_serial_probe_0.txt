Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because of the improper handling of memory allocation. The `info` variable is allocated using the `kmalloc` function without checking if the allocation was successful. If the memory allocation fails, it will result in the `info` variable being set to NULL, which can lead to a use-after-free or other undefined behavior, which is CWE-787.
