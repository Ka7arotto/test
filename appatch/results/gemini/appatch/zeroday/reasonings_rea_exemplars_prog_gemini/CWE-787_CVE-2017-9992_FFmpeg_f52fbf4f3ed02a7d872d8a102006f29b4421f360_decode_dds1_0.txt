A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because `frame` may be out of bounds when `frame - frame_end < width + 3`. This can happen when the `v` is larger than the remaining space in the `frame` buffer. In this case, writing to `frame[0]` and `frame[1]` can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
