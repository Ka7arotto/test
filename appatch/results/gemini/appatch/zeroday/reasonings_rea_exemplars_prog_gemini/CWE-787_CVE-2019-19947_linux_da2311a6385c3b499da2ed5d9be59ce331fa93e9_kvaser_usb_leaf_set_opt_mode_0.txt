Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because it's allocating memory for the `cmd` pointer without checking if the allocation was successful. If the memory allocation fails, the `cmd` pointer will be NULL, and dereferencing it in subsequent code will lead to a crash.
