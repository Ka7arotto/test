Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `event` pointer without checking if the memory allocation was successful. If `kmalloc` fails to allocate the required memory, the event will be set to NULL, and the subsequent use of this NULL pointer will lead to a segmentation fault. This can result in a program crash, which is a critical vulnerability.
