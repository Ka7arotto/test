A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because memory is allocated for `root_ops` at line 12 and `ri` at line 7, but there is no corresponding `kfree` calls to release this allocated memory. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not released before the function returns at line 15.
