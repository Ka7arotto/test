A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `rinfo` variable is allocated with a fixed size `SZ_SG_REQ_INFO * SG_MAX_QUEUE` without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, the code will continue to use the `rinfo` variable, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
