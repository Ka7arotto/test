A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the return value of the `XMALLOC` function is being cast to `mp_digit *` without first checking if the return value is NULL. If `XMALLOC` returns NULL, which it can do if memory allocation fails, then the cast will result in a NULL pointer being assigned to `a->dp`, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference later on when `a->dp` is used.
