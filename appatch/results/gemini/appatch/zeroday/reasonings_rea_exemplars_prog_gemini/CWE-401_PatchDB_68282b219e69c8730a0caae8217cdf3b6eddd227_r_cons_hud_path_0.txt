Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the 'files' pointer is allocated using `r_sys_dir` at line 17, but there is no corresponding call to free the allocated memory before exiting the function. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not released.
