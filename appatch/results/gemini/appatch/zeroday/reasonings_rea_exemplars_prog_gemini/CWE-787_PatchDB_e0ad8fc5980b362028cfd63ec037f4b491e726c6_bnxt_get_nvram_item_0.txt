Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the memory is allocated without checking if the `length` is valid. If the `length` is larger than the available memory, then allocating memory with `dma_alloc_coherent` can result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
