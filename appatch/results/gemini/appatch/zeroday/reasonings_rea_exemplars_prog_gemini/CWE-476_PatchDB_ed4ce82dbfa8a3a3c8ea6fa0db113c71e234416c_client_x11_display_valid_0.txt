A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlen` function is being called on the `display` pointer without first checking if it is NULL. If `display` is NULL, passing it to `strlen` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
