A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function may return `NULL` if there is not enough memory to allocate. This can happen if the `len` parameter is larger than the available memory. In this case, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability can occur when the `realloc` function returns `NULL` and the `p` pointer is used to access memory that has not been allocated, which is CWE-787.
