A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable line of code at line 76 and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability issue exists in the code because the allocated memory for `pool->nonce1`using `strdup` function is not being freed before the function returns. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not released after its effective lifetime.
