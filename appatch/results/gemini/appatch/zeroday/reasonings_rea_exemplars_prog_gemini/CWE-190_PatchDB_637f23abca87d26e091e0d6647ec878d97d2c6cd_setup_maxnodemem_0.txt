A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the vulnerable line, the root cause for the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is that the number of nodes or the memory size may be very large, more than what can be represented by the type of `node`, which is a `long` in this case. When the number of nodes or the memory size exceeds the maximum value that `long` can hold, an Integer Overflow occurs, potentially leading to undefined behavior or vulnerabilities.
