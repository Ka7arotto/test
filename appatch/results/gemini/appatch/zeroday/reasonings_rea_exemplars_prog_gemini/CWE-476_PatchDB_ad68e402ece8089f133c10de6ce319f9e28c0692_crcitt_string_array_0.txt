A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the code attempts to access `src[i].s` without first checking if `src` is NULL or if `i` is within bounds. If `src` is NULL or if `i` is out of bounds, then accessing `src[i].s` will result in a NULL pointer dereference or an out-of-bounds memory access, respectively.
