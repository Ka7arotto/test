Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `length` is declared as an `int`, which is a 32-bit signed integer type. If the value assigned to `length` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a 32-bit signed integer, it will result in an integer overflow or wraparound vulnerability, leading to undefined behavior. This can potentially cause unexpected results or security vulnerabilities. It's recommended to use an appropriate unsigned integer type, such as `size_t` or `uint32_t`, to handle the length value to avoid this vulnerability.
