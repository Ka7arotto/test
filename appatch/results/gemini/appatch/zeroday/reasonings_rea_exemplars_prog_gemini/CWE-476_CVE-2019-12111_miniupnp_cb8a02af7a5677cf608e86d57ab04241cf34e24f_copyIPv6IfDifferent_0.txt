Root Cause Analysis: The code is attempting to copy the contents of the `src` pointer to the `dest` pointer. However, it is not checking if either pointer is NULL before dereferencing them. If either `dest` or `src` is NULL, the `memcpy` call will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
