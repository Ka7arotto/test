A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the provided vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists because the variable `buflen` is used to access the `buf` array without checking if `buflen` is within the bounds of the array. If `buflen` is greater than the size of the `buf` array, then writing to `buf[buflen]` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
