A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the `inst_name` buffer is allocated memory using `snprintf` at line 7, but there is no corresponding `free` call before the function returns at line 34. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not released after its effective lifetime.
