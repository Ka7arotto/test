Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given code line and its context, there is insufficient information to determine the root cause of a CWE-190 vulnerability. The declaration of the variable `ret` alone does not provide specific details about how it is used within the function. To accurately analyze the root cause, more context about how `ret` is being used, especially in relation to integer operations, is required.
