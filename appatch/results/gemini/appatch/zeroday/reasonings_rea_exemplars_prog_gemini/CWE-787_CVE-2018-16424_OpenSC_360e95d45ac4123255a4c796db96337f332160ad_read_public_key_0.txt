A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `count` parameter passed to `sc_read_binary` may be larger than the size of the `buf` array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can occur if the size of the file is larger than the size of the `buf` array, resulting in an out-of-bounds write when `sc_read_binary` attempts to write more data than the `buf` array can hold, which is CWE-787.
