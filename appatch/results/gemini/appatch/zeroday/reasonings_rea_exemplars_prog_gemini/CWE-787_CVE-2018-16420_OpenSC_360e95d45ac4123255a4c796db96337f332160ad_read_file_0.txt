A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the function `realloc` is used to allocate memory for `p` without checking if `len` is 0. If `len` is 0, then the allocation will fail, and `p` will be set to NULL. This can lead to a null pointer dereference, which is a security risk.
