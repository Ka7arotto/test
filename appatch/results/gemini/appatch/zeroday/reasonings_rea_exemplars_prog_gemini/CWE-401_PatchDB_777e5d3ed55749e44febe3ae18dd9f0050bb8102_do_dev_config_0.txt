A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the `devs` variable is reallocated using `krealloc` at line 57, but the original memory allocated to `devs` is not freed. This can lead to memory leaks and potential resource exhaustion issues.
