A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `size` variable is calculated by multiplying `RAW_SAMPLES` by `s->streams[0]->codec->block_align`, but there is no check to make sure that the resulting size is not greater than the size of the buffer pointed to by `pkt`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the packet is larger than the size of the buffer. This can result in writing data beyond the bounds of the buffer, causing a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
