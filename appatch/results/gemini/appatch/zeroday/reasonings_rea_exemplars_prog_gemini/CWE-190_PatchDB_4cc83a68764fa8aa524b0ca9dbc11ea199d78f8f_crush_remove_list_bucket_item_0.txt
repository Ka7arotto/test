A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the variables `i` and `j` are declared as `int`, which is a 32-bit integer type. If the values assigned to these variables during the execution of the function exceed the maximum value that `int` can hold, it may result in an integer overflow or wraparound vulnerability, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
