A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the index 74 is used to access the `rdesc` array, which is out of bounds. The `rdesc` array has a size of 74, so the valid indices are 0 to 73. Accessing the array at index 74 will lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
