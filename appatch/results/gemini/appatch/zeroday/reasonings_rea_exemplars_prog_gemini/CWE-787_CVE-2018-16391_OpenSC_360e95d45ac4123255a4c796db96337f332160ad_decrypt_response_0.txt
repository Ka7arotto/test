Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `cipher_len` parameter is not checked to ensure that it is a valid value before using it to access the `plaintext` array. This can lead to accessing the `plaintext` array out-of-bounds, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
