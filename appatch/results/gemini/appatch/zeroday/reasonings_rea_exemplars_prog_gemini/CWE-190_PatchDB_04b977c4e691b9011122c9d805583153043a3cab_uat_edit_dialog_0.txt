**Root Cause Analysis:**

The CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability in the given code is due to the potential overflow in the argument `row` when passed to the callback function `uat->copy_cb`. If `row` is a large positive value, casting it to an `int *` may result in an integer overflow, leading to unpredictable behavior or security vulnerabilities. This can occur if the `uat` structure's `record_size` field is not properly initialized or validated.
