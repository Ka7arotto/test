A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `buf` array is not initialized before being passed to the `sc_read_binary` function. This means that it is possible that the `buf` array contains garbage data, which could be written to the file. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the amount of data written to the file is larger than the size of the `buf` array, which is CWE-787.
