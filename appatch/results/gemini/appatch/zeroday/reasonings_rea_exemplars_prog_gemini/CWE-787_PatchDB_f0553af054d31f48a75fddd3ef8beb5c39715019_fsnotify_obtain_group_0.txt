Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 vulnerability exists in the code because `kmalloc` is used to allocate memory for the `group` variable without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, `group` will be set to `NULL`, and the subsequent line will attempt to access `group->fsnotify_events`, which will lead to a null pointer dereference vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
