A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the `rtsp_st->dynamic_protocol_context` variable is allocated memory but is not being released appropriately within the loop. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not released before the loop exits.
