A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `av_new_packet` function may not be able to allocate enough memory for the `pkt` packet. This can happen if the size of the packet is larger than the size of the `pkt` buffer. In this case, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability can occur when `av_new_packet` writes more data than the size of the `pkt` buffer, which is CWE-787.
