A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because `ctx` is dereferenced to access the `param` member and subsequent operations on it without first checking if the `ctx` pointer itself is NULL. If `ctx` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `param` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
