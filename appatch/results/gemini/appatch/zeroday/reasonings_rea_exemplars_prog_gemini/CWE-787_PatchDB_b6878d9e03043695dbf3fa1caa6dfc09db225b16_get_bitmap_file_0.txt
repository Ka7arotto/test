Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `file` variable is being assigned a pointer to allocated memory without checking if the allocation was successful. If the memory allocation fails, the `file` variable will be assigned a null pointer, and accessing it will result in a segmentation fault, which is a security risk.
