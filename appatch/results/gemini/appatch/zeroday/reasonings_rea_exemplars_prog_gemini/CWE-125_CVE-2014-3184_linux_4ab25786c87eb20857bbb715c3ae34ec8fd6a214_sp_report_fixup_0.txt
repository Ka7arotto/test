A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `111` is used to access the `rdesc` array without proper bounds checking. If the `rdesc` array has a size of less than 112 bytes, this access will lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
