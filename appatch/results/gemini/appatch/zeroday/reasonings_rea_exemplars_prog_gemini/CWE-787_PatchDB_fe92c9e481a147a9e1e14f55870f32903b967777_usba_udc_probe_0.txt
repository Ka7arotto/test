Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `pdata->num_ep` is not checked for being 0. If `pdata->num_ep` is 0, then allocating memory for `usba_ep` with `sizeof(usba_ep) * pdata->num_ep` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
