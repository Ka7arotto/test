A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `p` pointer without checking if the `len` parameter is valid. If `len` is larger than the maximum allowed size for the `p` pointer, then `realloc` will allocate memory beyond the bounds of the `p` pointer, causing a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
