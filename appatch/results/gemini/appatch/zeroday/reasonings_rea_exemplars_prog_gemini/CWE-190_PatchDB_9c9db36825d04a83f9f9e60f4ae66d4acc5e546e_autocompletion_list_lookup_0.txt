A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlen` function returns a `size_t` type, which is typically an unsigned integer. If the input string is extremely large, it can cause an integer overflow when assigning the return value of `strlen` to the unsigned integer variable `str_len`. This integer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
