A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `full_size` variable may be larger than `KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `full_size` is larger than the maximum size that can be allocated by `kmalloc`.
In this case, `kmalloc` will fail and return NULL, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
