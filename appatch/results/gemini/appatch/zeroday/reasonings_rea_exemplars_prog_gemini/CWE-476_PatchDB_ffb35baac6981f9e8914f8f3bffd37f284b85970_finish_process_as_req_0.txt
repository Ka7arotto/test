Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `egress` macro is being invoked without first checking if `errcode` is non-zero. If `errcode` is zero, then `state->status` will be NULL, and dereferencing it in the `assert` statement will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
