A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the `file` pointer is allocated using `g_file_new_for_uri` at line 27, but there is no corresponding `g_object_unref` call to release the memory allocated for `file` before the function returns at line 38. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not released after its effective lifetime.
