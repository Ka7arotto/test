Root Cause Analysis: The presence of uninitialized integer variables `len` and `i` without proper initialization increases the risk of undefined behavior, including the potential for integer overflow or wraparound vulnerabilities (CWE-190). Without proper initialization, the values of `len` and `i` are indeterminate, leading to unpredictable behavior. This can become an issue in subsequent code sections where these variables may be used in arithmetic operations or array indexing, potentially resulting in unexpected or erroneous results.
