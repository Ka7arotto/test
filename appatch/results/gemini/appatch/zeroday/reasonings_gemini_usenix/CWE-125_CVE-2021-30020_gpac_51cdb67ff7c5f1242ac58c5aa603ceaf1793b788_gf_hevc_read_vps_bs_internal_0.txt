## Reasoning Steps for CWE-125 Patch:

The vulnerability at line `14 (vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id])` is a potential out-of-bounds read (CWE-125), not an out-of-bounds write as you mentioned. This happens because the code doesn't check for negative values of `vps_id`. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

**Step 1: Root Cause Analysis**

* **Data Source**: `vps_id` is read from a bitstream (`gf_bs_read_int_log`) with no explicit bounds checking. 
* **Potential Issue**:  While the code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, it **doesn't account for negative values**.
* **Vulnerability**: If `vps_id` is negative, accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]` will lead to an out-of-bounds read, accessing memory outside the allocated bounds of the `vps` array.

**Step 2: Fixing Strategy**

* **Boundary Check**: To prevent out-of-bounds reads, we need to ensure `vps_id` falls within the valid index range of the `vps` array (presumably 0 to 15, inclusive). 
* **Adding a Lower Bound Check**: The fix is to include a check for negative values of `vps_id` along with the existing check for values exceeding the upper bound.

**Patch Explanation**

 14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
 ```

* The added condition `(vps_id < 0)` ensures that negative values of `vps_id`, which would lead to an out-of-bounds read, are also caught.
* This makes the code more robust by enforcing that `vps_id` always falls within the valid index range before accessing the `vps` array.
