Let's break down this CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability and the reasoning behind the patch.

**Step 1: Root Cause Analysis**

* **Dynamic Allocation:** Inside the loop (lines 7-17), the code iterates through `rt->rtsp_streams`, which appears to be an array of `RTSPStream` pointers.  Importantly, there's a strong indication that these `RTSPStream` structures were dynamically allocated earlier in the code (we don't see the allocation in this snippet, but it's implied).
* **Conditional Resource Release:** The code does attempt to clean up resources:
    * **Line 14:** It calls `rtsp_st->dynamic_handler->close(...)`, which likely releases resources held by the `dynamic_protocol_context`.
    * **Line 18:**  `av_free(rt->rtsp_streams)` is called *after* the loop, freeing the array holding the pointers. 
* **The Leak:** The critical issue is that while the code frees the *array* holding the `RTSPStream` pointers, it **never frees the individual `RTSPStream` structures themselves**. This leads to a memory leak – the memory allocated for each `RTSPStream` becomes unreachable and unusable.

**Step 2: Fixing Strategy**

To prevent the memory leak, we need to ensure that every dynamically allocated `RTSPStream` is properly released. The most logical place to do this is within the loop, immediately after we're done using each `RTSPStream`.

**The Patch Explained**

```diff
<             }
<         }
---
>             }
>             av_free(rtsp_st);
>         }
```

* **Line Added:** The key addition is `av_free(rtsp_st);`. This line directly frees the memory pointed to by `rtsp_st`, which represents the current `RTSPStream` in the iteration.
* **Placement:** The placement of the `av_free` is crucial:
    * **Inside the `if (rtsp_st)` block:**  Ensures we only attempt to free a valid pointer.
    * **After potential resource release:** It's placed after the call to `rtsp_st->dynamic_handler->close(...)`, ensuring any resources held *within* the `RTSPStream` are released before freeing the structure itself.

**Why This Matters**

* **Resource Exhaustion:** Memory leaks lead to programs gradually consuming more and more memory over time.  Eventually, this can cause the program to crash or significantly degrade system performance.
* **Security Risks:**  Unreleased memory can sometimes contain sensitive data. Although not directly exploited in this case, memory leaks can contribute to a larger attack surface. 

**Best Practices**

* **Ownership and Lifetime:** Carefully consider which part of your code is responsible for allocating and freeing memory.
* **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):**  If your programming language supports it (like C++), RAII techniques (e.g., using smart pointers) can help automate resource management and prevent these types of leaks. 
* **Code Reviews and Static Analysis:** Tools can often detect potential memory leaks early in the development process.
