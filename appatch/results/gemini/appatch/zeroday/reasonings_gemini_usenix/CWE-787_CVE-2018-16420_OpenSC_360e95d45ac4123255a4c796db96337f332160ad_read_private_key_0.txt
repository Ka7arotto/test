## Reasoning for Patching CWE-787 in `sc_read_binary`

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning behind the patch for the given code:

**Step 1: Identify the Vulnerability - Out-of-Bounds Write**

* **Data Flow:** The issue stems from how data flows from `read_private_key` to `sc_read_binary`. 
* **Buffer Size:** In `read_private_key`, `bufsize` is set to `file->size`. This value represents the amount of data to be read from the smart card file.
* **Uncontrolled Write:**  The problem arises when `sc_read_binary` is called. It uses `buf` (size 2048 bytes) to store the read data, but `count` (passed as `bufsize`) could potentially be larger than the size of `buf`. If `file->size` is larger than 2048, `sc_read_binary` will write beyond the allocated memory of `buf`.

**Step 2: Root Cause Analysis**

* **Lack of Bounds Checking:**  The root cause is the absence of a check to ensure that `bufsize` (the amount of data to be read) does not exceed the size of the `buf` buffer.  

**Step 3: Patch Strategy - Enforce Size Limit**

* **Solution:** To prevent the out-of-bounds write, we need to ensure that `sc_read_binary` never attempts to write more data than `buf` can hold. 
* **Implementation:** The patch modifies how `bufsize` is calculated in `read_private_key`:
   ```diff
   < 	bufsize = file->size;
   ---
   > 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf); 
   ```
* **Explanation:** The `MIN` macro ensures that `bufsize` is set to the smaller value between `file->size` and the actual size of `buf` (2048 bytes). This prevents `sc_read_binary` from writing beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Conclusion**

By using the `MIN` macro, the patch effectively enforces a size limit on the amount of data read by `sc_read_binary`. This prevents the potential buffer overflow and enhances the security of the code by mitigating the CWE-787 vulnerability.
