Let's break down the reasoning behind this CWE-476 (Null Pointer Dereference) patch.

**Step 1: Root Cause Analysis**

1. **Potential `NULL` Pointer:**  The code allocates memory for `tbl` using `kmalloc`. Like any memory allocation function, `kmalloc` can fail and return `NULL` if there's insufficient memory. 

2. **Unprotected Dereference:** The vulnerable line immediately uses `tbl` without checking if the allocation was successful. If `kmalloc` did return `NULL`, accessing `tbl->it_index` would lead to a null pointer dereference, crashing the system.

**Step 2: Fixing Strategy**

The core issue is the missing check for a `NULL` pointer after `kmalloc`. The fix is straightforward:

1. **Check for `NULL`:** Immediately after allocating memory for `tbl`, add a condition to check if `tbl` is indeed `NULL`.

2. **Handle Allocation Failure:** If `tbl` is `NULL`, handle the allocation failure gracefully. In this case, returning `NULL` from the function is a common approach. This signals to the caller that the allocation and, consequently, the function's operation failed.

**Patch Explanation**

```

By adding the `if (tbl == NULL)` check and the subsequent `return NULL;`, we ensure that `tbl` is never dereferenced if the memory allocation fails. This prevents the null pointer dereference and improves the robustness of the code.
