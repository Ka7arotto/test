## Reasoning Steps for Patching CWE-787 Vulnerability

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning behind the patch for the CWE-787 vulnerability:

**Step 1: Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Data Flow:** Trace the flow of data that determines the size of the buffer and the amount of data being read:
    - `buf`: A buffer of size 2048 bytes declared on line 69.
    - `bufsize`:  Initially uninitialized, gets assigned the value of `file->size` on line 84.
    - `sc_read_binary()`: This function reads data from the card into the `buf` buffer with a maximum size specified by `count`, which is passed `bufsize` as an argument.

2. **Vulnerable Behavior:**
    - The size of the data read from the card (`file->size`) is not validated against the size of the destination buffer (`buf`). 
    - If `file->size` is larger than 2048 bytes (the size of `buf`), `sc_read_binary` will write past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Step 2: Fixing Strategy:**

To prevent the vulnerability, we need to ensure that `sc_read_binary` never writes more data into the buffer than the buffer can hold. This can be achieved by:

1. **Limiting the Read Size:** Instead of blindly passing `file->size` as the read size, we need to determine the safe amount of data that can be written into the buffer.
2. **Using the Minimum Value:**  We should take the smaller value between `file->size` and the actual size of the buffer (`sizeof(buf)`) to ensure we never exceed the buffer's boundaries.

**The Patch:**

 2 		   unsigned char *buf, size_t count, unsigned long *flags)

```

This patch modifies line 84 to assign `bufsize` with the minimum value between `file->size` and `sizeof(buf)`. Now, even if `file->size` is larger than 2048 bytes,  `sc_read_binary` will only read a maximum of 2048 bytes, preventing the buffer overflow.

**Note:** The patch assumes a `MIN` macro or function is available. If not, a ternary operator (as shown in the corrected patch) or an `if` statement can be used to achieve the same result.
