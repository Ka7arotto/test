Let's analyze the code and understand why the provided patch fixes the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds write) vulnerability.

**Step 1: Root Cause Analysis**

1. **Data Flow:**  The vulnerability arises within the `else if` block starting at line 29. Let's break down the data flow:
   - **Line 30:** `v = bytestream2_get_le16(gb)*2;`  We fetch a 16-bit value (`v`) from the bytestream and multiply it by 2.
   - **Line 31:** `if (frame - frame_end < v)`  We check if adding `v` to the current `frame` pointer would go beyond the `frame_end`. This check is intended to prevent buffer overflows, but it's incomplete.
   - **Line 33:** `frame += v;` If the previous check passes, we advance the `frame` pointer by `v`.
   - **Line 35:** `if (frame_end - frame < width + 3)` Another bounds check, intending to ensure enough space for at least `width + 3` bytes.
   - **Lines 37-42:** This is where the vulnerability occurs.  We write 4 bytes to the `frame` buffer: 2 bytes at `frame[0]` and `frame[1]`, and then another 2 bytes after advancing the `frame` pointer by 2.

2. **Insufficient Bounds Check:** The root cause lies in the bounds check on line 35: `if (frame_end - frame < width + 3)`. It only accounts for `width + 3` bytes, but the subsequent write operations (lines 37-42) attempt to write 4 bytes. If the remaining space in the buffer (`frame_end - frame`) is exactly `width + 3` bytes, this will result in an out-of-bounds write by one byte.

**Step 2: Fixing Strategy**

The fix is straightforward: we need to ensure that the bounds check on line 35 accurately reflects the number of bytes being written. Since we write a total of 4 bytes, the condition should be:

```
if (frame_end - frame < width + 4) 
```

**Why this Patch Works**

By changing the condition to `width + 4`, we ensure that there is enough space in the buffer for all 4 write operations before they are performed. This prevents the out-of-bounds write and fixes the CWE-787 vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

- This code appears to be decoding a compressed image or video frame. The specific details of the decoding algorithm are not crucial to understand the vulnerability and its fix.
- Secure coding practices emphasize the importance of careful bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Always ensure that your code verifies that array indices and pointer offsets are within the valid range of the allocated memory.
