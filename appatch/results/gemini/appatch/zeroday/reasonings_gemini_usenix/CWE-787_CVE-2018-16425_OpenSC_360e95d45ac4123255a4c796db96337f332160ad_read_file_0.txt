## Reasoning Steps for Patching CWE-787 in `read_file` function:

**Step 1: Root Cause Analysis**

- **Uncontrolled File Size:** The vulnerability arises from the possibility of `file->size` being 0 when `file` is not NULL. This happens if `sc_select_file` succeeds in selecting a file, but the file itself has a size of 0 bytes. 
- **Zero Allocation with `realloc`:**  The code then uses this potentially zero value for `len` in the `realloc` call.  While `realloc(ptr, 0)` is allowed, its behavior is implementation-defined. It can either return NULL or a unique pointer that can't be dereferenced. 
- **Potential Out-of-Bounds Write:** If `realloc` returns a valid (but zero-sized) buffer and the code proceeds to write data into it (assuming `len` is used for subsequent data reading), it would lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

**Step 2: Fixing Strategy**

The fix aims to prevent `len` from being 0 in situations where a valid file was selected:

- **Conditional Check on `file->size`:** The patch adds a check `file->size > 0` to the conditional expression. Now, `len` is set to `file->size` only if:
    -  `file` is not NULL (meaning a file was selected) AND
    -  `file->size` is greater than 0 (meaning the file has a non-zero size).
- **Default Allocation:** If either of these conditions is not met, `len` defaults to 4096, ensuring a minimum buffer size for subsequent operations.

**Patch Explanation:**

```diff
< 	len = file ? file->size : 4096;
---
> 	len = file && file->size > 0 ? file->size : 4096;
```

This patch effectively prevents scenarios where `realloc` is called with a size of 0 after a successful file selection. It ensures a minimum buffer size, mitigating the risk of out-of-bounds writes and potential memory corruption.
