Let's break down the reasoning for this patch.

**Step 1: Root Cause Analysis**

- **Data Flow:** The vulnerability stems from the variable `pps_id`. It's read from a bitstream using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id")`.  Critically, we don't have immediate guarantees about the potential values of `pps_id` after this read operation.
- **Array Indexing:**  The value of `pps_id` is then used as an index into the `vvc->pps` array.  
- **Missing Bounds Check:** The original code only checks if `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64. This leaves a crucial gap: what if `pps_id` is negative?  A negative index would lead to accessing memory *before* the start of the `vvc->pps` array, resulting in a classic out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CWE-125).

**Step 2: Fixing Strategy**

To prevent the out-of-bounds read, we need a more comprehensive bounds check:

1. **Lower Bound:** Ensure `pps_id` is not negative (`pps_id >= 0`).
2. **Upper Bound:** Ensure `pps_id` is less than the size of the `vvc->pps` array. Assuming the array has a fixed size of 64, this check remains as `pps_id < 64`.

**The Patch Explained**

```diff
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64)) 
```

The patch addresses the vulnerability by adding the essential lower bound check (`pps_id < 0`). Now, the code only proceeds to access `vvc->pps[pps_id]` if `pps_id` falls within the valid index range of the array (0 to 63 inclusive).

**Key Takeaway**

Always be cautious when using external data, especially values read from files or network streams, to index arrays or buffers. Robust bounds checking is essential to prevent out-of-bounds memory access vulnerabilities.
