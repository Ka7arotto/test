## Reasoning Steps for Generating Patch:

The vulnerability lies in the potential integer overflow within the `av_new_packet` function call. Here's a breakdown:

**Step 1: Identify Potential Overflow Points**

The expression `8 + (32 + 4 + size) * codec->channels` is used to calculate the size of the packet. This calculation involves additions and multiplications, which can lead to integer overflows if the intermediate or final results exceed the maximum value representable by the data type used.

**Step 2: Analyze Data Types and Limits**

- `size`: The data type of `size` is not explicitly mentioned, but it's likely an integer type.
- `codec->channels`: This is likely an integer type representing the number of audio channels. 
- `av_new_packet`: This function likely expects the packet size as an integer type.

Considering common integer types like `int` (typically 32-bit), we need to ensure that the calculations don't exceed the maximum value (`INT_MAX`).

**Step 3: Evaluate Potential Overflow Conditions**

1. **`size` Overflow:** If `size` is very large, `32 + 4 + size` could overflow even before multiplying with `codec->channels`. 
2. **Multiplication Overflow:** Even if `32 + 4 + size` doesn't overflow, multiplying it with `codec->channels` could result in an overflow.
3. **Final Addition Overflow:** After multiplication, adding 8 to the result could also lead to an overflow.

**Step 4: Implement Overflow Checks**

The patch addresses these potential overflow conditions:

+>         {
+>             return AVERROR_INVALIDDATA;
+>         }
+>         if (av_new_packet(pkt, 8 + (32 + 4 + size) * codec->channels) < 0)
+```

- **Check 1: `size > (INT_MAX - 32 - 4)`**: This checks if adding 32 and 4 to `size` would exceed `INT_MAX`, preventing overflow in the initial addition.
- **Check 2: `(32 + 4 + size) > (INT_MAX / codec->channels)`**: This checks for potential overflow during multiplication. By dividing `INT_MAX` by `codec->channels`, it determines the maximum value  `(32 + 4 + size)` can have before multiplication to avoid overflow.
- **Check 3: `(32 + 4 + size) * codec->channels > INT_MAX - 8`**:  This checks if the final addition of 8 would exceed `INT_MAX`. 

If any of these checks are true, it indicates a potential integer overflow, and the function returns an error (`AVERROR_INVALIDDATA`) to prevent further processing with potentially corrupted data.

**Conclusion:**

The patch effectively mitigates the CWE-787 vulnerability by introducing checks to detect and prevent integer overflows during the packet size calculation. This ensures that the program handles potentially malicious or erroneous inputs safely, preventing buffer overflows and maintaining the integrity of the application.
