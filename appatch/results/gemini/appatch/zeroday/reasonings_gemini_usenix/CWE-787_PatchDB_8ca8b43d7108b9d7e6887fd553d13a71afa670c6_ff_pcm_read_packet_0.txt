## Reasoning Steps for Patching CWE-787 in ff_pcm_read_packet

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning behind the provided patch:

**Step 1: Root Cause Analysis**

1. **Input Analysis:** The vulnerable function `av_get_packet` takes `size` as an argument, which determines the amount of data to read into the provided packet (`pkt`).

2. **Calculation of `size`:**  The `size` variable is calculated by multiplying `RAW_SAMPLES`, `s->streams[0]->codec->block_align`. We need to consider scenarios where this calculation might result in:
   * **Negative Value:**  If either `RAW_SAMPLES` or `s->streams[0]->codec->block_align` are negative (perhaps due to incorrect input or data corruption), `size` will be negative. 
   * **Zero Value:** If either `RAW_SAMPLES` or `s->streams[0]->codec->block_align` are zero, `size` will be zero.

3. **Impact on `av_get_packet`:** Passing a negative or zero value for `size` to `av_get_packet` is likely unintended and could lead to undefined behavior or vulnerabilities. 

    * **Negative Size:** A negative size doesn't make sense in this context and could cause `av_get_packet` to interpret the value unexpectedly, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption.
    * **Zero Size:** A size of zero might result in unexpected behavior.  While it might not directly lead to a buffer overflow, it might signal an error condition that should be handled gracefully.

**Step 2: Fixing Strategy**

The core issue is the lack of validation for the calculated `size` before it's used in `av_get_packet`. The patch addresses this by:

1. **Adding Input Validation:** The code now includes a check: `if (size <= 0)`. This directly addresses the potential for negative or zero values.

2. **Handling Invalid Input:** If `size` is invalid (less than or equal to zero), the function returns an error code (`AVERROR(EINVAL)`), indicating that the input parameters or internal state are invalid. This prevents the problematic call to `av_get_packet` and allows the calling code to handle the error appropriately.

**Conclusion**

The patch effectively mitigates the CWE-787 vulnerability by adding a critical input validation step. This ensures that only valid and meaningful `size` values are passed to `av_get_packet`, preventing potential buffer overflows, memory corruption, and undefined behavior.
