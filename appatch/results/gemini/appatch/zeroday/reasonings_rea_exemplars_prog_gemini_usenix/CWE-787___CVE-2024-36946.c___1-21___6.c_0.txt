Unfortunately, I need more context from the code snippet to give you a precise step-by-step analysis of a potential CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability. 

**Here's why and what's missing:**

* **Incomplete Code:** The provided snippet cuts off abruptly.  We don't see the full arguments passed to `nlmsg_new` or the subsequent usage of the allocated `skb` (socket buffer). This missing information is crucial to understanding:
    * **Data Size Calculation:** What additional data size is being added to `sizeof(struct ifaddrmsg)` inside `nlmsg_new`? This calculation is where the vulnerability often hides.
    * **Buffer Handling:** How is `skb` used after allocation?  Is there potential for writing data beyond the allocated size determined by `nlmsg_new`?

* **Function Behavior:** While the name `nlmsg_new` suggests it allocates memory for a netlink message, without its definition or documentation, I can't definitively state its internal bounds-checking mechanisms. 

**How a CWE-787 Vulnerability Could Occur:**

1. **Insufficient Size Calculation:**  If the calculation inside `nlmsg_new` doesn't accurately account for the total data size intended to be stored in the `skb` buffer, it could allocate an insufficiently sized buffer.

2. **Later Data Writes:** Subsequent code might write data to `skb` (e.g., using functions like `memcpy`,  accessing `skb->data`, etc.). If the amount of data written exceeds the allocated buffer size determined by the potentially flawed calculation in `nlmsg_new`, it would lead to an out-of-bounds write.

**To Give You a More Complete Analysis:**

Please provide the following:

* **Full Code:**  The complete code snippet, especially the rest of line 6 and any lines where data is written to `skb`.
* **Function Definitions/Documentation:** If possible, provide the definitions or documentation for `nlmsg_new`, `NLMSG_ALIGN`, and any other relevant functions or macros used.

With this additional information, I can provide a more accurate and detailed vulnerability analysis.
