Q: Given the following code slice:
```
given the following code: 
1 void cycle0(struct st *hello){
5    int num = hello->getOfferNum();
6    int offered[max_offered + 1];
7    for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
8        offered[i] = hello->getOffer(i);} 
```
which has CWE-787 (Out-of-bound write) vulnerability at line:
```
offered[i] = hello->getOffer(i);}
```
Starting with input variable hello, reason about the vulnerable behavior step by step until the vulnerability is determined.
A: 
- 1: Validate `num`:
  - `num` is obtained from `hello->getOfferNum()`. We need to consider what values `num` might take.
  - If `num` is greater than `max_offered + 1`, this could lead to an out-of-bounds access in the `offered` array.

- 2: Array Size and Indexing:
  - The size of the `offered` array is fixed at `max_offered + 1`.
  - The loop iterates `num` times. If `num` is greater than `max_offered + 1`, then `offered[i]` will access indices beyond the bounds of the array, leading to undefined behavior.

- 3: Potential Vulnerability:
  - The vulnerability arises if `num` exceeds `max_offered + 1`, which results in writing past the end of the `offered` array.
  - This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability. Writing outside the bounds of the allocated array can corrupt adjacent memory, potentially leading to crashes or exploitable conditions.

### Conclusion:
The vulnerable behavior in this code is a buffer overflow. It occurs because the loop does not ensure that `num` is within the bounds of the allocated array size `max_offered + 1`. If `num` is greater than `max_offered + 1`, the loop will write past the end of the `offered` array, leading to potential memory corruption and security vulnerabilities. Proper bounds checking should be added to ensure `num` does not exceed `max_offered + 1`.
