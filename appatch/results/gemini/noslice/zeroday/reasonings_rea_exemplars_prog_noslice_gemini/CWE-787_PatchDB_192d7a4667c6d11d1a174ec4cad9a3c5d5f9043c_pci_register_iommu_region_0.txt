A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `rp` is used to store a resource without checking if the memory allocation was successful. If the memory allocation fails (i.e. `kmalloc` returns NULL), then using `rp` to store a resource can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
