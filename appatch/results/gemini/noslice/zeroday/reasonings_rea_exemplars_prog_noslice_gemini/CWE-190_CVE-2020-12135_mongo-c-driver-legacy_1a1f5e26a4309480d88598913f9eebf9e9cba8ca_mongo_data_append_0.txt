A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the `len` parameter is of type `int`, which is a signed integer type. If a negative value is passed as the `len` parameter, it can lead to an integer overflow when used in the `memcpy` function, causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
