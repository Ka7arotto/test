Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `rinfo` variable is allocated with the size `SZ_SG_REQ_INFO * SG_MAX_QUEUE` without checking if the size is valid. If the size is too large, then allocating memory for `rinfo` with this size can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
