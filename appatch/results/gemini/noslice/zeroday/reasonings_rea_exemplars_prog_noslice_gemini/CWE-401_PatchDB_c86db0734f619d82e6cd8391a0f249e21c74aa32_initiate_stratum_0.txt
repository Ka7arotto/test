A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the `pool->nonce1` variable is allocated memory using `strdup` but is not freed before the function returns. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not released even after the nonce1 is no longer required. This can potentially lead to memory exhaustion issues if not handled properly.
