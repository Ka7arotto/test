Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `cmd` pointer is allocated using `kmalloc` without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, `cmd` will be NULL, and accessing `cmd` in subsequent lines will result in a null pointer deference, which is a security risk.
