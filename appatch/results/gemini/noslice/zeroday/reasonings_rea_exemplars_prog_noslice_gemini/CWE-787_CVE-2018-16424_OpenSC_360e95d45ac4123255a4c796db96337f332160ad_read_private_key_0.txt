A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `buf` array is not checked for length before being passed to `sc_read_binary`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `count` parameter passed to `sc_read_binary` is larger than the size of the `buf` array, which is CWE-787.
