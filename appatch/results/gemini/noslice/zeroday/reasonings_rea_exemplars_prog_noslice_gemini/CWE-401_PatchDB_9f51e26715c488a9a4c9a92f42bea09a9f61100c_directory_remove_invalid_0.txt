A: Root Cause Analysis: Although the function summary for `routerlist_assert_ok` is missing, the vulnerability in the given code slice lies at line 61. Looking at the code before this line, smartlist `nodes` is allocated but not freed before the function returns. This can lead to a resource leak, and the memory allocated for `nodes` will not be released if an error occurs in the function.
