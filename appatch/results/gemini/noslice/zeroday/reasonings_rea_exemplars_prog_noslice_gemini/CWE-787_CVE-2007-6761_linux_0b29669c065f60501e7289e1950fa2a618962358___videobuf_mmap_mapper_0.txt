Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `map` variable, but the memory is not initialized before using it. This can lead to writing to uninitialized memory, which is a security risk.
