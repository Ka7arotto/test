Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `memset` function is called with the `count` as the third argument, which is not checked for being greater than the size of the `to` buffer. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability if the `count` is greater than the size of the `to` buffer, which is CWE-787.
