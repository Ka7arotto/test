A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the kmalloc() function is used to allocate memory for the vi pointer, but the size of the memory allocated is not checked before using it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the allocated memory is too small to hold the data that is being copied into it. This can result in writing data beyond the bounds of the allocated memory, causing a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
