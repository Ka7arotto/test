**Root Cause Analysis**: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `prevGlyph` variable is assigned the value of `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index]` without checking if `id` and `index` are valid values. If either `id` or `index` is out of bounds, this could lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
