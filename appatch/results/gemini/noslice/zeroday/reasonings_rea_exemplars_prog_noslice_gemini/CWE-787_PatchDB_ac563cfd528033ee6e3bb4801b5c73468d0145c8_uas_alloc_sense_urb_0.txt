A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `iu` variable is allocated using `kmalloc` without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, the `iu` variable will be NULL, and attempting to access it will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
