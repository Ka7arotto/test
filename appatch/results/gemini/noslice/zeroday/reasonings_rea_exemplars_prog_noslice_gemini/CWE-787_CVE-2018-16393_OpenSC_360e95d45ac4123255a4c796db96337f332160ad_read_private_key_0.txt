Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary()` function is called with a `buf` parameter that may not have enough space to hold the data read from the card. This can occur if the `count` parameter passed to `sc_read_binary()` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. In this case, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability can occur when `sc_read_binary()` writes more data to the `buf` array than it can hold, which is CWE-787.
