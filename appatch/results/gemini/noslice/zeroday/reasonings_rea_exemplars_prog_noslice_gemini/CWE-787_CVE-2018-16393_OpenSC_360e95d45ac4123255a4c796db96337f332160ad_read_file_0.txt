Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, a CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is being used to allocate memory for the `data` pointer without checking if the size of the memory to be allocated is valid. If the `len` variable is not properly validated or constrained and is larger than the available memory, the `realloc` function may allocate more memory than intended, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
