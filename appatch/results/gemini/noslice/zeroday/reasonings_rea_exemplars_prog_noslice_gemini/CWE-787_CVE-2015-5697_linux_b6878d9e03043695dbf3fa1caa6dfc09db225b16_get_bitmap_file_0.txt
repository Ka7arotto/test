Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `file` variable is allocated using `kmalloc` without checking the size of the allocated memory. If the size of the allocated memory is less than the size of the `mdu_bitmap_file_t` structure, then there is a risk of writing beyond the allocated memory, causing a buffer overflow. This buffer overflow vulnerability is CWE-787.
