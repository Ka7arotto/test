A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is used to allocate memory for `p` without checking if `len` is 0. If `len` is 0, then `realloc` will return a NULL pointer, which will cause the program to crash when `p` is dereferenced. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
