Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` is used to access the `hevc->vps` array without proper bounds checking. If `vps_id` is negative, or greater than or equal to 16, it may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-125.
