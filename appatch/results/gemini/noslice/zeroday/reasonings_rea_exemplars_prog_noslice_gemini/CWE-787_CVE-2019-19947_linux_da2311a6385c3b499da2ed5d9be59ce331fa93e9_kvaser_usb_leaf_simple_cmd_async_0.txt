A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `cmd` pointer, but the returned memory is not checked for `NULL`. If the `kmalloc` function fails to allocate memory, the `cmd` pointer will be `NULL`, and the subsequent use of the `cmd` pointer in line 15 will result in a null pointer dereference vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
