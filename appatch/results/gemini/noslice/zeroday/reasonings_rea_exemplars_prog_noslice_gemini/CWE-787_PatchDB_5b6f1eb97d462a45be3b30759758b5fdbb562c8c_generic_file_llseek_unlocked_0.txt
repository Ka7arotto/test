Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `offset` variable is being incremented by `file->f_pos`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write if `file->f_pos` is negative and `offset` is incremented to a value that is greater than the maximum file size.
