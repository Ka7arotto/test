A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `asctime` function may return NULL if the `tm` pointer is NULL. However, the code does not check for this case, and it attempts to use the returned string directly by calling `g_strdup` on it, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if `asctime` returns NULL.
