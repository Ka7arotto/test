A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it is passing the `tbl` pointer to `of_parse_dma_window` without first checking if `tbl` is NULL. If `tbl` is NULL, then dereferencing it to access its fields in the function call will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
