A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `_stream->send` function is called without checking if the `data` parameter is valid and within bounds. If the `data` parameter is not valid or exceeds the bounds of the destination buffer, the `_stream->send` function may write beyond the bounds of the intended buffer, which is a CWE-787.
