A: Root Cause Analysis:
Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `buf` array may not have enough space to store the data read from the file. This can happen if the `count` parameter passed to `sc_read_binary` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. In this case, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability can occur when `sc_read_binary` writes more data than the size of the `buf` array, which is CWE-787.

Please provide the summary of the function sc_read_binary.
