Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `cmd` variable is allocated using `kmalloc` without checking if the memory allocation succeeded. If the memory allocation fails, then using the uninitialized `cmd` variable can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
