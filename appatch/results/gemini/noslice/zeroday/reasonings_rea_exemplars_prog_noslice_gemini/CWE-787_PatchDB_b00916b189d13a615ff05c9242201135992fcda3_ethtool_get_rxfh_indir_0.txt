Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `full_size` variable is not checked to ensure that it is within a valid range before being passed to `kmalloc`. It appears that the `full_size` variable is calculated based on user-provided input, specifically the `table_size` value copied from the user in line 11. If the user provides an excessively large value for `table_size`, it is possible for `full_size` to exceed the maximum allowed size for a kernel allocation (KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE), potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
