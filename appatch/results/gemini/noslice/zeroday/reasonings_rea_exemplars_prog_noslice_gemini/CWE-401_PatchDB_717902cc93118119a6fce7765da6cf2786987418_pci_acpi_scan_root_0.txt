A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because when the code returns an error at line 15, it only frees the memory allocated for `ri` at line 8, but it does not free the memory allocated for `root_ops` that was created at line 12. This can lead to a memory leak as the allocated memory for `root_ops` will not be released.
