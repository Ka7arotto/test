A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the `length` variable is declared as an integer (`int`) without specifying its size. Depending on the architecture and compiler settings, an integer can be 16, 32, or 64 bits. If the value assigned to `length` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the `int` data type, it may result in an integer overflow, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
