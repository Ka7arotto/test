Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `ssl->cert->key->x509` pointer is being used without being checked for NULL. If `ssl` or any of its nested pointers (e.g., `cert`, `key`, `x509`) are NULL, dereferencing them to access the `x509` member will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
