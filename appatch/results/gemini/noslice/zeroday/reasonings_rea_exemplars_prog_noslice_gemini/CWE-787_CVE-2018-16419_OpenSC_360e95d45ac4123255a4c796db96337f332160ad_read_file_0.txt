Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is used to reallocate memory for the `*data` pointer without checking the return value. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `realloc` function fails to allocate memory. In this case, `realloc` can return `NULL`, which will cause the `*data` pointer to be set to `NULL`. This can result in writing data beyond the bounds of the allocated memory, causing a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
