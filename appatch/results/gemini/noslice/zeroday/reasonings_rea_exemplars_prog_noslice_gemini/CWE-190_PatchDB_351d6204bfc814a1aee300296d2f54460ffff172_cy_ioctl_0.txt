Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the multiplication operation `(arg * HZ)` may result in an integer overflow if the value of `arg` is large and `HZ` is also large. Assigning the result to `cyz_polling_cycle` without proper overflow checking can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
