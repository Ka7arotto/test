Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `p` pointer, but the `len` variable is not checked to ensure that it is within bounds. If `len` is larger than the size of the memory allocated for `p`, then `realloc` will attempt to allocate more memory than is available, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
