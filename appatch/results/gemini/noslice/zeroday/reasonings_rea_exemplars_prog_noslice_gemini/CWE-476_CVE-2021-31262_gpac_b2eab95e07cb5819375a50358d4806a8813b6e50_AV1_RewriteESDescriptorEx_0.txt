**Root Cause Analysis**: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists because it assumes that `av1->av1_config` is not NULL and directly accesses `av1->av1_config->config` without checking for NULL. If `av1->av1_config` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `config` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
