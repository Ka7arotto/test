Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `p` pointer without checking if the `len` parameter is valid. If `len` is not a valid value, then `realloc` may allocate memory outside of the bounds of the available memory, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
