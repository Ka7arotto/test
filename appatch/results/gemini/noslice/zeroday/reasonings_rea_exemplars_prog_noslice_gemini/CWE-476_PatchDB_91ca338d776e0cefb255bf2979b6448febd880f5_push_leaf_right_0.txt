A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `right` pointer is not checked for NULL before being passed to `btrfs_tree_lock`. If `right` is NULL, passing it to `btrfs_tree_lock` will result in a NULL pointer dereference because `btrfs_tree_lock` expects a valid pointer to a locked extent buffer.
