Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `thresholds` pointer is being used without being checked for NULL. If `thresholds` is NULL, the subsequent operation to access `thresholds[y * SOLO_MOTION_SZ + x]` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
