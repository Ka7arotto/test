A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the memory for `regbuf` is allocated without checking if the size of the memory (i.e. `reglen`) is valid. If `reglen` is 0, then allocating memory for `regbuf` with `reglen` will result in an out-of-bounds memory allocation, which is CWE-787.
