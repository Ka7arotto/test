A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `drc` variable is used as an index in the `wm8994->drc_cfg` array without checking if it is a valid value. If `drc` is negative or greater than or equal to the length of the `wm8994->drc_cfg` array, it may lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
