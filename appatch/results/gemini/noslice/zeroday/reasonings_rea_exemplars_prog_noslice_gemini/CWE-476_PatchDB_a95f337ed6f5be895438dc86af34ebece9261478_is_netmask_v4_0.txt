A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strchr` function can return NULL, and the code following it assumes that the returned pointer is valid and dereferences it without checking for NULL. Specifically, if `ip_strv4` does not contain the character '/', `mask_str` will be NULL, and the subsequent operations on it at lines 8-10 will result in a NULL pointer dereference.
