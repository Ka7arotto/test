Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `info` variable is allocated with the size of its structure, which is `sizeof(*info)`, without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, the `info` pointer will be NULL, and accessing the memory through this pointer will result in an out-of-bounds write, which is a CWE-787 vulnerability.
