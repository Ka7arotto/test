Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it is possible that the `ptr` pointer is not initialized or set to a valid value before being used in the addition operation at line 15. If `ptr` is NULL, adding `off` to it will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
