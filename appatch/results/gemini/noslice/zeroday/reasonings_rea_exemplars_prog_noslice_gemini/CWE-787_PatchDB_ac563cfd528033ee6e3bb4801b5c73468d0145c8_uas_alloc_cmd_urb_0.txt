Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `len` is used to allocate memory for the `iu` pointer without checking if `len` is 0. If `len` is 0, then allocating memory for `iu` with `sizeof(*iu) + len` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
