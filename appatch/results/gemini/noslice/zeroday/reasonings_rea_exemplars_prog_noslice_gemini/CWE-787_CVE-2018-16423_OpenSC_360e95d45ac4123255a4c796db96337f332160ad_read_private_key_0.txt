Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 vulnerability exists in the function because the `count` parameter is not checked if it is less than or equal to 0 before being passed to the `sc_read_binary` function. If `count` is less than or equal to 0, then `sc_read_binary` may read data outside the bounds of the `buf` array, resulting in a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
