A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `buf` array is allocated with a fixed size of `BUFSIZ` bytes, but the `rtadv_recv_packet` function may receive a packet that is larger than the size of the `buf` array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the packet received by `rtadv_recv_packet` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. This can result in writing data beyond the bounds of the `buf` array, causing a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
