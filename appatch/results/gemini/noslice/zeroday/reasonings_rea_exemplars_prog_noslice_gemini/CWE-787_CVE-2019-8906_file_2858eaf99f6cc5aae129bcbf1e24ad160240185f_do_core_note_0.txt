Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (memory out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `memcpy` function is used to copy `descsz` bytes from `nbuf + doff` to `&pi`, but it is not checked if `descsz` is within the bounds of the `nbuf` array. If `descsz` is larger than the size of the `nbuf` array, it can lead to a memory out-of-bounds write, which is CWE-787.
