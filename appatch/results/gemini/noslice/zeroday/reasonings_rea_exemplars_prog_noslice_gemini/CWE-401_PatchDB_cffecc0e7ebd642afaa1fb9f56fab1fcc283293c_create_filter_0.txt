Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the allocated memory for `inst_name` and `tmp_args` using `snprintf` at lines 7 and 22 is not freed before the function returns at line 34. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not released before the function exits.
