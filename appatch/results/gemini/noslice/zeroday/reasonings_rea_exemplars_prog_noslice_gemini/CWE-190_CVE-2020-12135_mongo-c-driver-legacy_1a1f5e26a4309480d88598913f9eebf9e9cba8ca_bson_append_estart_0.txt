Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the expression `1 + len + dataSize` may result in an integer overflow if the values of `len` and `dataSize` are large. If the result of this expression exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the data type of `b`, it may lead to undefined behavior and potentially cause unexpected results or security vulnerabilities.
