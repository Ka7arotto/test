A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary` function is called with the `buf` array as an argument. The size of the `buf` array is not checked before calling `card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary`, so it is possible that `card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary` will write more data to the `buf` array than it can hold. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Below is a summary of the `sc_read_binary` function:
```
int sc_read_binary(sc_card_t *card, unsigned int idx,
                   unsigned char *buf, size_t count, unsigned long *flags)
```
The `sc_read_binary` function reads `count` bytes from the file at index `idx` on the smart card `card` into the buffer `buf`. The function returns 0 if successful, or a negative value on error.
