Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it is accessing the ha pointer in the memcpy function without first checking if it is NULL. If ha is NULL, then accessing ha->addr in the memcpy will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
