Root Cause Analysis:  Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `init_get_bits` function is passed a pointer to the source buffer `ptr` and the length of the source buffer `ptr_len * 8`. However, the `init_get_bits` function does not check if the source buffer is large enough to hold the specified length of data. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the source buffer is smaller than the specified length, causing a CWE-787 vulnerability.
