Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strchr` function returns NULL if the specified character is not found in the string. In this case, if the '/' character is not found in the `ip_strv6` string, `mask_str` will be set to NULL. The subsequent assignment of `'\0'` to the character pointed to by `mask_str` will then result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
