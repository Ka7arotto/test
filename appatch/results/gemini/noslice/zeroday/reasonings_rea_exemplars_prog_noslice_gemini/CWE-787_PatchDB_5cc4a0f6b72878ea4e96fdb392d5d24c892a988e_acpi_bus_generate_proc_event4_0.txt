Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because it's not checking the return value of `kmalloc()`. If `kmalloc()` fails and returns a null pointer, the subsequent code will attempt to access memory through the null pointer, which will result in a segmentation fault. To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of `kmalloc()` and return an error if it fails.
