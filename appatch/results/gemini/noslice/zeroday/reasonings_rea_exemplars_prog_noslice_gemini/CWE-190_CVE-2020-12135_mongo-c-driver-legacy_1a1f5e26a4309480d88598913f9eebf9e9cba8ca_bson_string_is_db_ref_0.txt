A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because there is no check to ensure that `length` is non-negative before using it as an index into the `string` array. If `length` is negative, accessing elements of the `string` array based on it can result in undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities like accessing memory outside intended bounds.
