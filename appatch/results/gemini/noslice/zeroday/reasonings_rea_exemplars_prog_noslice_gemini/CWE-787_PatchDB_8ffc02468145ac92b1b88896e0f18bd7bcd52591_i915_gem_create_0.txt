Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `i915_gem_alloc_object` function is used to allocate memory for the `obj` object, but it is possible that the function will fail and return NULL. If this happens, the caller will continue to use the `obj` pointer, which is invalid, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
