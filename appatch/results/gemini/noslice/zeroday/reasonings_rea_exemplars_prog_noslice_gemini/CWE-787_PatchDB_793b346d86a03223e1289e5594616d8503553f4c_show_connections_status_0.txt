Root Cause Analysis:
Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 vulnerability exists in the code because the `alloc_bytes` function is used to allocate memory for the `array` without checking if `count` is 0. This can lead to allocating a zero-length array, which can cause a memory leak. This can result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
