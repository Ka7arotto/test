Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `node` is declared as a `long` type, which is a 32-bit signed integer on most architectures. If the input string `str` contains a value that is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a 32-bit signed integer, it will result in an integer overflow and undefined behavior. This can lead to unexpected results or security vulnerabilities due to the improper handling of the input value.
