Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it is accessing the `.s` field of `src[i]` without first checking if `src[i]` itself is NULL. If `src[i]` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `.s` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
