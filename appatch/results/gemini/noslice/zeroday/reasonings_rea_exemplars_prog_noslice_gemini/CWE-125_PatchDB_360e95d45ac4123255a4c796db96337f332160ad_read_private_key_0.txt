A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `bufsize` variable is assigned the value of the `sc_file_get_size` function without checking the return value. If the return value indicates an error, `bufsize` may be set to an invalid value, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when the buffer `buf` is accessed.
