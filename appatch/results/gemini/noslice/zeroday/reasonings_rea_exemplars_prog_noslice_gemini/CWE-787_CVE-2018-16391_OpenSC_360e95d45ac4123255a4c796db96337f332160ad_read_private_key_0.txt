A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `sc_read_binary` function is called with the `buf` parameter as an out parameter, but the size of the `buf` array is not checked before calling `sc_read_binary`. This can lead to writing data beyond the bounds of the `buf` array, which is CWE-787.
