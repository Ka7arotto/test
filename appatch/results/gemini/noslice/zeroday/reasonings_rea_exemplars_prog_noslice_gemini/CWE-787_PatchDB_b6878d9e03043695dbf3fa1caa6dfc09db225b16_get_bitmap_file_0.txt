Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the memory allocated for `file` is not checked for a null pointer before using it. If `kmalloc` fails to allocate memory, it will return a null pointer, and trying to use that null pointer will result in an out-of-bounds write, which is CWE-787.
