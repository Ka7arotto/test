A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmallo`c memory allocation function is used without checking if the allocated memory is NULL. If the `kmallo`c memory allocation is not successful, the `path` variable will be a dangling pointer and dereferencing it in the subsequent lines will result in a segmentation fault, which is a security concern and can lead to exploitation. This vulnerability is covered by CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write.
