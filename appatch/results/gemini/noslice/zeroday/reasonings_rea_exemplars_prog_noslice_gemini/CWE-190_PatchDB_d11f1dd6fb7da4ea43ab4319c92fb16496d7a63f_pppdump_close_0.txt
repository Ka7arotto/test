Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `i` is declared as an integer without specifying its size (e.g., `int32_t` or `int64_t`), and it is used as an index to iterate through the elements of the `pids` array. If the `pids` array contains a large number of elements, the integer value of `i` may overflow, leading to undefined behavior. This can potentially cause unexpected results or security vulnerabilities.
