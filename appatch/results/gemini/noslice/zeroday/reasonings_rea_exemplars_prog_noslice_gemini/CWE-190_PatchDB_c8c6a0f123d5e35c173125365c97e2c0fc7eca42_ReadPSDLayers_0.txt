Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the value returned by `ReadBlobByte(image)` is assigned to a `MagickSizeType` variable, which may not be large enough to hold the value. If the returned value is negative or exceeds the maximum value that `MagickSizeType` can hold, it may result in an integer overflow or wraparound, leading to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.
