A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `prev` pointer is being used to access its `sibling` field without being checked for NULL. If `prev` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `prev->sibling` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
