Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the memory reallocation function `realloc` is used without first checking the return value. If the `realloc` function fails, the `p` pointer will be set to `NULL`. As a result, when the `sc_read_binary` function is called in line 23, it will attempt to write data to the `NULL` pointer, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
