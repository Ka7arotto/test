The provided code snippet is incomplete and lacks context. **We cannot determine a CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** vulnerability based on the given information. 

Here's why:

* **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** occurs when data is written past the boundaries of a buffer. This code only declares two constant void pointers (`sb` and `se`) without any initialization or usage. 
* **Missing context:**  We need to see how `sb` and `se` are used within a function, particularly how they are accessed and modified. 
* **Incomplete code:** The provided code snippet is incomplete. The line numbers (1 and 9) suggest there is other code surrounding the declaration. 

**To provide a comprehensive analysis, please provide:**

1. **Complete code snippet:** Include the entire function or relevant code block where these pointers are used.
2. **Explanation of the variables:**  What do `sb` and `se` represent in your code? 
3. **Intended functionality:** What is the purpose of the code snippet and how are these pointers intended to be used?

With more information, I can help you identify the root cause of the potential vulnerability and suggest appropriate fixes.
