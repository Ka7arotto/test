The provided code snippet does **not** exhibit a CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability at the specified line. Let's break down why:

**Understanding the Code**

The code implements a constructor (`nvkm_firmware_ctor`) for a structure likely representing firmware data (`nvkm_firmware`). Here's a breakdown:

- **Lines 2-3:** Function signature taking function pointers, device information, firmware source, length, and a pointer to the `nvkm_firmware` structure.
- **Lines 5-8:** Initializes the `nvkm_firmware` structure with provided values.
- **Line 10:** Begins a `switch` statement based on the `type` member of the structure pointed to by `fw->func`.
- **Line 12:** Inside a `case` (not shown fully), it allocates kernel memory using `kmemdup` and copies the firmware data from `src` to `fw->img`. The size of the allocation is determined by `fw->len`.
- **Line 15:** **Crucially, this line calculates the page-aligned length of the firmware and stores it back into the `len` variable.** The original `len` (firmware size) is overwritten.

**Why There's No CWE-476 Here**

- **No Pointer Dereferencing:** The problematic line (15) does not dereference any pointers. It performs an arithmetic calculation using `ALIGN` which is likely a macro for page alignment. Even if `fw` was NULL, this line wouldn't cause a crash.
- **Overwriting `len`:**  The code does overwrite the original `len` variable. While this might be unintentional and could have side effects elsewhere in the code, it doesn't directly lead to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Potential Issues**

- **Memory Leak:** If the code later relies on the original value of `len` for freeing the allocated memory, this overwriting could lead to a memory leak (since the aligned size might be larger).
- **Logic Error:** Overwriting `len` might indicate a logical flaw in how the code intends to use the firmware length information.

**Conclusion**

While the specified line doesn't cause a CWE-476 vulnerability, the code snippet hints at potential memory management or logic issues. To give a more precise analysis, the complete `switch` statement and how `len` is used subsequently are needed.
