The code snippet you provided is insufficient to determine the presence of a CWE-125 vulnerability (Out-of-bounds Read) at the specified line. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Context:**  CWE-125 vulnerabilities occur when a program reads data from outside the bounds of a buffer or array.  To assess this, we need more context:
    * **What does `iwl_mvm_mld_rm_sta_from_fw` do?**  Crucially, how does it use `sta_id`? Does it access an array or buffer using `sta_id` as an index or offset? 
    * **What is the expected range of `sta_id`?** Are there any checks to ensure that `sta_id` is within the valid bounds before it's used by `iwl_mvm_mld_rm_sta_from_fw`? 

* **Possible False Positive:** Without understanding how `sta_id` is utilized within `iwl_mvm_mld_rm_sta_from_fw`, flagging this line as CWE-125 could be a false positive. 

**To properly analyze for CWE-125:**

1. **Examine `iwl_mvm_mld_rm_sta_from_fw`:**  Analyze the function definition to understand:
    * How it uses the `sta_id` parameter.
    * If it performs any bounds checking on `sta_id`.
    * If it accesses any memory based on `sta_id` (e.g., arrays, buffers).
2. **Trace Data Flow:** Track how the `sta_id` variable is assigned and modified before it reaches the call to `iwl_mvm_mld_rm_sta_from_fw`.  Are there any potential points where an out-of-bounds value could be assigned?

**Example (Illustrative):**

Let's say `iwl_mvm_mld_rm_sta_from_fw` contains something like this:

```c
int iwl_mvm_mld_rm_sta_from_fw(struct iwl_mvm *mvm, u8 sta_id) {
  struct station_info *sta_table = mvm->stations;
  // ...
  return sta_table[sta_id].some_value; // Potential CWE-125!
}
```

Here, if `sta_id` is greater than or equal to the size of the `sta_table` array, you'd have an out-of-bounds read.

**Provide more context (the code for `iwl_mvm_mld_rm_sta_from_fw` and how `sta_id` is handled) so I can give you a more precise analysis.**
