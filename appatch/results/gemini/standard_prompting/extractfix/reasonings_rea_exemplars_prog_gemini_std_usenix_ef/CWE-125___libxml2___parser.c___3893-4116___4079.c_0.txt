The vulnerability at line 187 arises from an **out-of-bounds read** due to the lack of bounds checking in the `while` loop.

**Explanation:**

* **`len` Variable:** This variable represents the current length of the `buf` array, which stores the parsed attribute value.
* **`len--`:** Inside the loop, the `len` variable is decremented in each iteration.
* **Lack of Bounds Check:** There is no check to ensure that `len` remains within the valid bounds of the `buf` array.

**Vulnerability:**

If the `len` variable gets decremented to a value less than 0, the expression `buf[len - 1]` would access memory locations outside the allocated `buf` array. This can lead to:

* **Memory Corruption:** Modifying memory outside the allocated space can corrupt data, leading to crashes or unpredictable behavior.
* **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive data in adjacent memory locations.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the absence of bounds checking in the `while` loop. The code assumes that `len` will always be greater than or equal to 1, but this is not guaranteed.  The loop iterates as long as `buf[len - 1]` is a space character, potentially leading to `len` becoming negative.

**Remediation:**

To fix the vulnerability, add a bounds check before accessing `buf[len - 1]` inside the `while` loop:

```c
while (len > 0 && buf[len - 1] == 0x20) 
    len--;
```

This ensures that `len` is always within the bounds of the `buf` array, preventing the out-of-bounds read.
