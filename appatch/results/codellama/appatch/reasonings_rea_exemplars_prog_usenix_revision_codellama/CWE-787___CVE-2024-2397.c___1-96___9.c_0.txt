This code snippet appears to be declaring two const void pointers, `sb` and `se`, which are used in a function call later on. There doesn't appear to be any indication of a vulnerability in this snippet alone. However, if we were to assume that this code is part of a larger program, then it is possible that the input values for these pointers could be malicious and lead to a buffer overflow or other security issue.

A potential CWE-787 vulnerability could occur if the values being used for `sb` and `se` are not properly validated before they are used in the function call. If the values are too large, it could cause the function to write past the end of a buffer, leading to a buffer overflow or other security issues.

In order to determine if this is indeed a vulnerability, we would need to see more context about how these pointers are being used and validated throughout the program.
