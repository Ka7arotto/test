Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static void event_interrupt_wq_v10(struct kfd_node *dev,
2 					const uint32_t *ih_ring_entry)
4 	uint16_t source_id, client_id, pasid, vmid;
8 	source_id = SOC15_SOURCE_ID_FROM_IH_ENTRY(ih_ring_entry);
9 	client_id = SOC15_CLIENT_ID_FROM_IH_ENTRY(ih_ring_entry);
15 	if (client_id == SOC15_IH_CLIENTID_GRBM_CP ||
20 		if (source_id == SOC15_INTSRC_CP_END_OF_PIPE)
22 		else if (source_id == SOC15_INTSRC_SQ_INTERRUPT_MSG) {
95 		} else if (source_id == SOC15_INTSRC_CP_BAD_OPCODE) {```
which has a vulnerability among CWE-787 and among lines:
```
95 		} else if (source_id == SOC15_INTSRC_CP_BAD_OPCODE) {
```
Please generate five possible patches for the vulnerability.
A: The patch can be done in two steps.
Step 1. The given code contains a potential vulnerability among CWEs CWE-787 and SOC15_INTSRC_CP_BAD_OPCODE.
The vulnerability arises from the fact that there is no bounds checking on the `source_id` variable, which means it can take any value within its range.
If an attacker were to send a specially crafted input to trigger this code path, they could potentially cause a buffer overflow by sending a source ID that is greater than `SOC15_INTSRC_CP_BAD_OPCODE`.
To mitigate this vulnerability, proper bounds checking should be added to ensure that `source_id` does not exceed its maximum value.
