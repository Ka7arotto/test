Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int clone_submodule(const struct module_clone_data *clone_data,
6 	char *sm_alternate = NULL, *error_strategy = NULL;```
which has a vulnerability among CWE-476 and among lines:
```
6 	char *sm_alternate = NULL, *error_strategy = NULL;
```
Please generate five possible patches for the vulnerability.
A: The patch can be done in two steps.
Step 1. The given code snippet is declaring two character pointers `sm_alternate` and `error_strategy`, which are being initialized to null. However, there is a potential vulnerability in this code as these variables are not checked for proper initialization before use. This could lead to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities if the variables are used without proper initialization.

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to check if `sm_alternate` and `error_strategy` have been properly initialized before using them. This can be done by checking their values against null or by providing default values in case they are not initialized.
