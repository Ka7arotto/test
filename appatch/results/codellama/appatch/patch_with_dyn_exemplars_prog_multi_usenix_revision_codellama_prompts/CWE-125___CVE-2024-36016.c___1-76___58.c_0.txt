Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static void gsm0_receive(struct gsm_mux *gsm, unsigned char c)
3 	unsigned int len;
5 	switch (gsm->state) {
7 		if (c == GSM0_SOF) {
8 			gsm->state = GSM_ADDRESS;
9 			gsm->address = 0;
10 			gsm->len = 0;
11 			gsm->fcs = INIT_FCS;
15 		gsm->fcs = gsm_fcs_add(gsm->fcs, c);
16 		if (gsm_read_ea(&gsm->address, c))
17 			gsm->state = GSM_CONTROL;
20 		gsm->fcs = gsm_fcs_add(gsm->fcs, c);
21 		gsm->control = c;
22 		gsm->state = GSM_LEN0;
25 		gsm->fcs = gsm_fcs_add(gsm->fcs, c);
26 		if (gsm_read_ea(&gsm->len, c)) {
27 			if (gsm->len > gsm->mru) {
32 			gsm->count = 0;
33 			if (!gsm->len)
36 				gsm->state = GSM_DATA;
39 		gsm->state = GSM_LEN1;
42 		gsm->fcs = gsm_fcs_add(gsm->fcs, c);
43 		len = c;
44 		gsm->len |= len << 7;
45 		if (gsm->len > gsm->mru) {
50 		gsm->count = 0;
51 		if (!gsm->len)
54 			gsm->state = GSM_DATA;
57 		gsm->buf[gsm->count++] = c;
58 		if (gsm->count == gsm->len)```
which has a vulnerability among CWE-125 and among lines:
```
58 		if (gsm->count == gsm->len)
```
Please generate five possible patches for the vulnerability.
A: The patch can be done in two steps.
Step 1. The code appears to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of unchecked user-supplied data in a switch statement without proper bounds checking. Specifically, the `gsm->state` variable is set to `GSM_LEN1` when `len == 0xFF`, which could potentially cause an out-of-bounds write if the `gsm->count` variable is not checked properly.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by adding proper bounds checking for the `gsm->count` and `gsm->len` variables, as well as ensuring that the user-supplied data is properly validated before being used in a switch statement.
