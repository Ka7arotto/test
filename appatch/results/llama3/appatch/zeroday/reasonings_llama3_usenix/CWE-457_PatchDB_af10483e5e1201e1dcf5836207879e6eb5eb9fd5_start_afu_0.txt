To generate the patch for the CWE-457 vulnerability, we can follow these reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

- 1: Validate `afu->rrq_entry`:
  - The code assigns the address of `afu->rrq_entry[0]` to `afu->hrrq_start`.
  - We need to consider the state of `afu->rrq_entry` before this assignment. Is it initialized or does it contain garbage values?

- 2: Potential Vulnerability:
  - If `afu->rrq_entry` is not initialized before its address is assigned to `afu->hrrq_start`, it may contain arbitrary values.
  - This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes when the contents of `afu->rrq_entry` are accessed later in the program.

- 3: CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable:
  - The vulnerability arises because `afu->rrq_entry` is not initialized before its address is assigned to `afu->hrrq_start`.
  - This is a classic example of CWE-457, where the use of an uninitialized variable can lead to unpredictable behavior.

### Conclusion:
The vulnerable behavior in this code is the use of an uninitialized variable. It occurs because `afu->rrq_entry` is not initialized before its address is assigned to `afu->hrrq_start`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes when the contents of `afu->rrq_entry` are accessed later in the program. Proper initialization of `afu->rrq_entry` should be added to ensure predictable behavior.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

- A common fixing strategy for CWE-457 is to initialize the variable before its use.
- In this case, we can initialize `afu->rrq_entry` by setting all its bytes to zero using the `memset` function.
- The patch should include the initialization of `afu->rrq_entry` before its address is assigned to `afu->hrrq_start`.

The resulting patch is:
```
<     init_pcr(cfg);
<     afu->hrrq_start = &afu->rrq_entry[0];
---
>     init_pcr(cfg);
>     memset(&afu->rrq_entry, 0, sizeof(afu->rrq_entry));
>     afu->hrrq_start = &afu->rrq_entry[0];
```
This patch ensures that `afu->rrq_entry` is properly initialized before its address is assigned to `afu->hrrq_start`, preventing the CWE-457 vulnerability.
