The patch provided does not actually fix the CWE-125 vulnerability. CWE-125 is an "Out-of-bounds Read" vulnerability, which occurs when a program reads data past the end of a buffer. 

However, in this case, the code is writing to the buffer, not reading from it. The function `strlcpy` is used to copy a string to a destination buffer, and it does prevent buffer overflows by limiting the number of bytes copied.

The patch provided replaces `strlcpy` with `strncpy`, which is not necessarily an improvement. `strncpy` also copies a string to a destination buffer, but it does not guarantee null-termination of the destination string if the source string is longer than the destination buffer.

A more likely issue with this code is that it does not check the return value of `strlcpy` to ensure that the entire string was copied successfully. However, this is not a CWE-125 vulnerability.

If the intention is to fix a potential buffer overflow vulnerability, the patch should ensure that the buffer is null-terminated and that the string "kpp" is not longer than the buffer `rkpp.type`. However, since the code already uses `strlcpy`, which prevents buffer overflows, the patch provided does not actually fix a CWE-125 vulnerability.

A correct patch would be to check the return value of `strlcpy` to ensure that the entire string was copied successfully:

```c
if (strlcpy(rkpp.type, "kpp", sizeof(rkpp.type)) >= sizeof(rkpp.type)) {
    // handle error: buffer overflow
}
```

This patch checks if the return value of `strlcpy` is greater than or equal to the size of the buffer, which indicates that the buffer was not large enough to hold the entire string. If this condition is true, an error should be handled to prevent potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
