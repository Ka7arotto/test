The patching can be done in two steps.

### Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: 

Starting with input, reason about the vulnerable behavior until the vulnerability is determined:

- 1: Validate `av1->av1_config` and `av1->av1_config->config`:
  - The code checks if `av1->av1_config` is not null before accessing its members.
  - However, it does not check if `av1->av1_config->config` is null before passing it to the `AV1_DuplicateConfig` function.

- 2: Potential Vulnerability:
  - The vulnerability arises if `av1->av1_config->config` is null.
  - Passing a null pointer to the `AV1_DuplicateConfig` function can lead to a null pointer dereference, resulting in undefined behavior.

- 3: CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) Vulnerability:
  - The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference because it does not check if `av1->av1_config->config` is null before using it.
  - This can lead to a crash or potentially exploitable conditions.

### Conclusion:
The vulnerable behavior in this code is a null pointer dereference. It occurs because the code does not check if `av1->av1_config->config` is null before passing it to the `AV1_DuplicateConfig` function. Proper null pointer checks should be added to ensure that `av1->av1_config->config` is not null before using it.

### Step 2. Fixing Strategy. 

A common fixing strategy is to add null pointer checks to ensure that `av1->av1_config->config` is not null before using it. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `av1->av1_config->config` is null before calling the `AV1_DuplicateConfig` function. Therefore, the patch should be:

```c
< 	if (av1->av1_config) {
---
> 	if (av1->av1_config && av1->av1_config->config) {
```

This patch adds a null pointer check to ensure that `av1->av1_config->config` is not null before calling the `AV1_DuplicateConfig` function, preventing a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability.
