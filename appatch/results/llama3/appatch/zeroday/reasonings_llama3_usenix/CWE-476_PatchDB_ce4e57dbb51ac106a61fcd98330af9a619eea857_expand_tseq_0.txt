The patching can be done in two steps.

### Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: 

Starting with input, reason about the vulnerable behavior until the vulnerability is determined:

- 1: Validate `alloc_array_elem`:
  - The function `alloc_array_elem` is used to allocate memory for `ev`.
  - If `alloc_array_elem` fails to allocate memory, it will return a null pointer.

- 2: Potential Vulnerability:
  - The vulnerability arises if `alloc_array_elem` returns a null pointer and the code still tries to access `ev->ts`.
  - This is a classic example of a null pointer dereference vulnerability. Accessing memory through a null pointer can lead to crashes or exploitable conditions.

- 3: CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) Vulnerability:
  - The code does not check if `ev` is null before trying to access `ev->ts`.
  - If `ev` is null, the code will crash or exhibit undefined behavior when trying to access `ev->ts`.

### Conclusion:
The vulnerable behavior in this code is a null pointer dereference. It occurs because the code does not check if `ev` is null before trying to access `ev->ts`. If `ev` is null, the code will crash or exhibit undefined behavior. Proper null pointer checking should be added to ensure that `ev` is not null before trying to access its members.

### Step 2. Fixing Strategy. 

A common fixing strategy is to add a null pointer check after the memory allocation. If the allocation fails, the function should return an error code to indicate that the allocation failed. Therefore, the patch should be:

```c
<         ev = alloc_array_elem((void **)&s->events, sizeof(*ev), &s->nb_events, nb_ev_max);
<         ev->ts = tseq->ts.t;
---
>         ev = alloc_array_elem((void **)&s->events, sizeof(*ev), &s->nb_events, nb_ev_max);
>         if (!ev)
>         {
>             return AVERROR(ENOMEM);
>         }
>         ev->ts = tseq->ts.t;
```

This patch adds a null pointer check after the memory allocation. If the allocation fails, the function returns an error code `AVERROR(ENOMEM)` to indicate that the allocation failed. This prevents the null pointer dereference vulnerability and ensures that the code handles memory allocation failures correctly.
