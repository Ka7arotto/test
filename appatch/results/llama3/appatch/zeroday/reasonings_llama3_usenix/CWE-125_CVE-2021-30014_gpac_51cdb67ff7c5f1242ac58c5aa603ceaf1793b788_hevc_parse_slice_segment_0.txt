To generate the patch for the given code slice with a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds read) vulnerability, we can follow these reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

- 1: Validate `pps_id`:
  - `pps_id` is obtained from `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id")`. We need to consider what values `pps_id` might take.
  - If `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64, this could lead to an out-of-bounds access in the `hevc->pps` array.

- 2: Array Size and Indexing:
  - The size of the `hevc->pps` array is not explicitly stated, but it is implied to be 64 elements (since the check is for `pps_id >= 64`).
  - The code does not check if `pps_id` is negative. In C, negative indices are not valid for arrays.

- 3: Potential Vulnerability:
  - The vulnerability arises if `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64 or if `pps_id` is negative, which results in accessing the `hevc->pps` array out of its bounds.
  - This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability. Reading outside the bounds of the allocated array can lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes or exploitable conditions.

### Conclusion:
The vulnerable behavior in this code is a buffer overflow. It occurs because the code does not ensure that `pps_id` is within the bounds of the allocated array size. If `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64 or if `pps_id` is negative, the code will access the `hevc->pps` array out of its bounds, leading to potential memory corruption and security vulnerabilities. Proper bounds checking should be added to ensure `pps_id` is within the valid range.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `pps_id` cannot be larger than or equal to the size of the `hevc->pps` array or smaller than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to avoid `pps_id` being out of bounds. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```
This patch ensures that `pps_id` is within the valid range of the `hevc->pps` array, preventing potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
