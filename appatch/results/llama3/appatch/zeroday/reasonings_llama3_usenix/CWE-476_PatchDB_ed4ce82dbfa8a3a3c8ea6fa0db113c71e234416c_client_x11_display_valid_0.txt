The patching can be done in two steps.

### Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: 

- 1: Validate `display`:
  - The function `client_x11_display_valid` takes a `const char *display` as input.
  - We need to consider what values `display` might take.
  - If `display` is `NULL`, calling `strlen(display)` will result in undefined behavior.

- 2: Potential Vulnerability:
  - The vulnerability arises if `display` is `NULL`, which results in a null pointer dereference when calling `strlen(display)`.
  - This is a classic example of a null pointer dereference vulnerability. Dereferencing a null pointer can lead to crashes or exploitable conditions.

- 3: CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) Vulnerability:
  - CWE-476 occurs when a program attempts to access or manipulate memory through a null (i.e., invalid) pointer.
  - In this case, the null pointer dereference occurs when `strlen(display)` is called with a null `display` pointer.

### Conclusion:
The vulnerable behavior in this code is a null pointer dereference. It occurs because the function does not check if `display` is null before calling `strlen(display)`. If `display` is null, calling `strlen(display)` will result in undefined behavior. Proper null pointer checks should be added to ensure that `display` is not null before calling `strlen(display)`.

### Step 2. Fixing Strategy. 

A common fixing strategy is to add a null pointer check before calling `strlen(display)`. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check if `display` is null before proceeding with the function. If `display` is null, the function should return an error or a default value. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     size_t i, dlen;
<     dlen = strlen(display);
---
>     size_t i, dlen;
>     if (display == NULL)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     dlen = strlen(display);
```
This patch adds a null pointer check to prevent the null pointer dereference vulnerability. If `display` is null, the function returns 0, indicating that the display is invalid.
