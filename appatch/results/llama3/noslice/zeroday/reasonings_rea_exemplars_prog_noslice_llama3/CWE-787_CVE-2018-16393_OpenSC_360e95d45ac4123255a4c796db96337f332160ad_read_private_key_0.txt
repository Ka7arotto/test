Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `count` is used as the size parameter in the `read_binary` function call without checking if `count` is 0. If `count` is 0, then passing it to the `read_binary` function will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
