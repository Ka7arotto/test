Root Cause Analysis: 

Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because there is a potential memory leak when the `bss_cfg` pointer is allocated memory using `kzalloc` at line 13, but there is no corresponding deallocation of memory before the function returns in the default case of the switch statement at line 42. This can lead to memory leakage, which is a violation of CWE-401.
