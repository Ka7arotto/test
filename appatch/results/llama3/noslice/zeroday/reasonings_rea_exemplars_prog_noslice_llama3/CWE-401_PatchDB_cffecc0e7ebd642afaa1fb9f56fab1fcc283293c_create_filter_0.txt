Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because there is a potential memory leak when the `*filt_ctx` pointer is allocated memory using `avfilter_graph_alloc_filter` at line 14, but there is no corresponding deallocation of memory before the function returns in the error path at line 34. This can lead to memory leakage, which is a violation of CWE-401.
