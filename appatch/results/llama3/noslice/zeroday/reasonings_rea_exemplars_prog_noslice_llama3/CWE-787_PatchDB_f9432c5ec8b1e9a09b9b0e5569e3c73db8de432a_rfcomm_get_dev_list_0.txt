Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `dev_num` is used to calculate the size of memory allocation for `dl` without checking if `dev_num` is a large value. If `dev_num` is a large value, then allocating memory for `dl` with `sizeof(*dl) + dev_num * sizeof(*di)` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
