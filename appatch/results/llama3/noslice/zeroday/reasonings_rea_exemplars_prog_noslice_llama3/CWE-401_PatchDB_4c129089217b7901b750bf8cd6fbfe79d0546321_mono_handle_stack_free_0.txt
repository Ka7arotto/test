Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the `g_free(c)` call at line 14 is unnecessary and incorrect. The `c` pointer is already updated to point to the next chunk in the loop, so freeing it again at line 14 is redundant and can cause a double-free error. The correct approach is to remove the `g_free(c)` call at line 14, as the memory is already freed inside the loop.
