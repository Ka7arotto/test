Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because when `clear->nsc` allocation fails in line 9, the `clear` object allocated in line 4 is not freed, leading to a memory leak. The function returns `NULL` without releasing the memory allocated for `clear`, violating CWE-401.
