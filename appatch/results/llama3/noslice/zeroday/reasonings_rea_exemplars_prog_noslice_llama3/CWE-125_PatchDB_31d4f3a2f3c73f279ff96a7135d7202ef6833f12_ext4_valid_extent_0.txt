Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the variables `block` and `len` are used as parameters to the `ext4_data_block_valid` function without proper validation. It is unclear what validation is performed within the `ext4_ext_pblock` and `ext4_ext_get_actual_len` functions, but it is possible that they do not ensure the values of `block` and `len` are within valid bounds. If `block` or `len` can be manipulated to be out-of-bounds, it will lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125. Please provide the summary of the functions `ext4_ext_pblock` and `ext4_ext_get_actual_len` for further analysis.
