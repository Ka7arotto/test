Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `sizeof(*file)` is used to allocate memory for the `file` structure without checking if `sizeof(*file)` is 0 or a small value. If `sizeof(*file)` is 0 or a small value, then allocating memory for `file` with `sizeof(*file)` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
