Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability does not exist in the code because kmalloc is used to allocate memory for the `vi` pointer, and the size of the allocation is determined by `sizeof(virtrng_info)`, which is a fixed size. The vulnerability is likely a false positive.
