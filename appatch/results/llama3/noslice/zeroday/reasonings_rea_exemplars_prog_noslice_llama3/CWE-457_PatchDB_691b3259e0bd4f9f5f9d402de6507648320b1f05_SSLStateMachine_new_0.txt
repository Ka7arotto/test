Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable) vulnerability does not exist in this code slice. The `pMachine` variable is initialized with the result of `malloc` at line 3, and then its members are accessed and initialized subsequently. The `pCtx` member is initialized at line 6. There is no use of uninitialized variables in this code slice.
