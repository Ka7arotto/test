Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlcpy` function is used to copy the `dev->name` string into the `uaddr->sa_data` buffer with a fixed size of 15. However, there is no guarantee that `dev->name` will always be 14 characters or less (since `strlcpy` will truncate the string if it's longer than the buffer size minus 1). If `dev->name` is longer than 14 characters, it will lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.
