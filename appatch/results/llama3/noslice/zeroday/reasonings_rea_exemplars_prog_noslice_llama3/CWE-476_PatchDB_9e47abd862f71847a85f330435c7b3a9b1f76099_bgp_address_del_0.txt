Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because there is no check for a NULL pointer before accessing the `addr` pointer in the decrementation of `refcnt`. If `hash_lookup` returns NULL (i.e., `addr` is NULL), dereferencing it to access `addr->refcnt` will lead to a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability, which is CWE-476.
