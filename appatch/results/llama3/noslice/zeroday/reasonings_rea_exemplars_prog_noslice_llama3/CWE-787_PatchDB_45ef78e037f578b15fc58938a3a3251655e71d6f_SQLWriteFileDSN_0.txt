Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strncpy` function is used with a wrong order of arguments. The correct order is `strncpy(destination, count, source)`, but in this case, it is `strncpy(destination, count, source)`. This can lead to a buffer overflow, resulting in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
