Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the `depth` variable is of type `int`, which is a signed integer type. If the value of `depth` exceeds the maximum limit of a signed integer (i.e., `INT_MAX`), it can lead to an integer overflow or wraparound, causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
