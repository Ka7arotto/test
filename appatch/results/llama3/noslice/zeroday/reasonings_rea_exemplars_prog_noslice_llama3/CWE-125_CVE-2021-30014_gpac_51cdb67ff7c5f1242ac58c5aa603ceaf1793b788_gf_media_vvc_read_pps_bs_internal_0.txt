Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps->sps_id` is used to access an array or a data structure without proper bounds checking. In this specific case, the vulnerability is not directly related to the line `if (pps->sps_id >= 16)`. Instead, it is related to the fact that `pps->sps_id` is not properly validated before being used. 

The function `gf_media_vvc_read_pps_bs_internal` reads `pps_id` from the bitstream and checks if it is within the valid range (0 to 63). However, it does not perform the same validation for `pps->sps_id`. If `pps->sps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, it is considered invalid, and an error is logged. However, this does not prevent the out-of-bounds read. 

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper bounds checking for `pps->sps_id` before it is used to access an array or a data structure.
