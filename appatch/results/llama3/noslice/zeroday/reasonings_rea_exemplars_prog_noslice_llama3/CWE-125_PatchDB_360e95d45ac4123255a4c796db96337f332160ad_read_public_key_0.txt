Root Cause Analysis: 

Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `file->size` is used to assign the value to `bufsize` without proper validation. 

If `file->size` is larger than the actual size of the `buf` array, it will lead to a buffer overflow when `sc_read_binary` function is called at line 22, which is a CWE-125 vulnerability.
