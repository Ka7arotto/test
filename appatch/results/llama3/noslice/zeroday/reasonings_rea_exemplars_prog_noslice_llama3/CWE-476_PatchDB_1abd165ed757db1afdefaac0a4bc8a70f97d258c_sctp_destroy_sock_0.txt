Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because there is no check for a NULL pointer before accessing the `sp` pointer in the conditional statement. If `sp` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `sp->do_auto_asconf` will lead to a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability, which is CWE-476.
