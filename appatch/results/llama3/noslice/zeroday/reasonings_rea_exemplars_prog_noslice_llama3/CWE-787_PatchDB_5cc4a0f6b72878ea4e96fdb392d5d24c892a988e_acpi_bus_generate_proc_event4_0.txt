Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function allocates memory for the `event` structure without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, `kmalloc` returns `NULL`, and the subsequent operations on the `event` pointer (lines 14-17) will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
