Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the kmalloc function does not check for integer overflow when calculating the size of memory to be allocated. If the value of sizeof(*rp) is large, it may cause an integer overflow when multiplied by a large value, resulting in a smaller allocation than intended, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
