Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the function `ib_copy_from_udata` does not check the size of the destination buffer `cmd` before copying data from `ucore`. If the size of `cmd` is smaller than `sizeof(cmd)`, it will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
