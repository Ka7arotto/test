Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlcpy` function does not check if the destination buffer `rcipher.type` is large enough to hold the source string "cipher". If the buffer size is smaller than the length of the source string, it will lead to a buffer overflow, which is CWE-125.
