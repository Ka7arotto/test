Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `ptr_len` is used to calculate the bit length for `init_get_bits` function without checking if `ptr_len` is 0 or a negative value. If `ptr_len` is 0 or a negative value, then initializing the `GetBitContext` with `ptr_len * 8` bits will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
