Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `i` is used to access the `byte` array without proper bounds checking. In the `for` loop at line 17, the loop continues until `byte[i] & 0x7f` is true. If `i` becomes 0, the loop breaks, and then `i` is decremented at line 22 if `byte[i] & 0x40` is true. If `i` becomes negative or less than 0, it will lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when accessing `byte[i]` at line 23, which is CWE-125.
