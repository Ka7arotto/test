Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because there is no check for a NULL pointer before accessing the `ha` pointer in the `memcpy` function. If `ha` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `ha->addr` will lead to a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability, which is CWE-476.
