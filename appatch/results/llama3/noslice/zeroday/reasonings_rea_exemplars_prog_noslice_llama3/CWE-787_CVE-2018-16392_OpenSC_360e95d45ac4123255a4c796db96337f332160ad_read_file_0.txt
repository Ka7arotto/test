Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `len` is used to reallocate memory for `*data` without checking if `len` is 0 or a very large value. If `len` is 0, then reallocating memory for `*data` with `len` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787. Additionally, if `len` is a very large value, it may also lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
