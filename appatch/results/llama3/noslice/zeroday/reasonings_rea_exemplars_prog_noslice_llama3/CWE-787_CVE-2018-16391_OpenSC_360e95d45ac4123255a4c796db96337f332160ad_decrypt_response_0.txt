Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `cipher_len` is used to update the `out_len` variable without checking if `cipher_len` is less than or equal to 2. If `cipher_len` is less than or equal to 2, then updating `out_len` with `cipher_len - 2` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
