Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the `nest_level` is used as an index to access the `nest_size` array. If `nest_level` is large enough, it can cause an integer overflow when used as an index, leading to an out-of-bounds access. This can occur if `nest_level` exceeds the maximum valid index for the `nest_size` array.
