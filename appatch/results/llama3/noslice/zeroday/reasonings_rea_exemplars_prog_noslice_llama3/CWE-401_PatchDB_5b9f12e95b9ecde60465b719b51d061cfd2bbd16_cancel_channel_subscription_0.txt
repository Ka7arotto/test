Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability does not exist in the code. The memory allocated for the `objectlist` structure is properly deallocated using `free(list)` at line 16 when a subscription is cancelled. The `free` function is used correctly to release the memory, which prevents memory leakage. Therefore, there is no CWE-401 vulnerability in this code slice.
