Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the subtraction operation `(b->cur - b->data)` may result in an underflow if `b->cur` is less than `b->data`. This underflow can lead to an integer wraparound, causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
