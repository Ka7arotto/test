Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable) vulnerability exists in the code because the `afu` variable is not fully initialized before being used. Specifically, the `rrq_entry` array in the `afu` struct is not initialized before being accessed at line 15. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
