Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `sizeof(videobuf_mapping)` is used to allocate memory for `map` without checking if `videobuf_mapping` is a valid structure. If `videobuf_mapping` is not a valid structure or its size is not correctly defined, then allocating memory for `map` with `sizeof(videobuf_mapping)` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
