Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability does not exist in the code because the line `if (a == b)` is not dereferencing a pointer. It is checking if `a` and `b` are the same pointer. The vulnerability might exist elsewhere in the code, but not in this specific line.
