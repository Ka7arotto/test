Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `len` is used to reallocate memory for the `ret` array without checking if `len` is a large value. If `len` is a large value, then reallocating memory for `ret` with `size + len + 1` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
