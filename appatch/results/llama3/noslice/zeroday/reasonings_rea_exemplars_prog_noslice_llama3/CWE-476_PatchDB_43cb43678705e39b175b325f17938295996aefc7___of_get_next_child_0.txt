Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because there is no check for a NULL pointer before accessing the `prev` and `node` pointers. If either `prev` or `node` is NULL, dereferencing them to access `prev->sibling` or `node->child` will lead to a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability, which is CWE-476.
