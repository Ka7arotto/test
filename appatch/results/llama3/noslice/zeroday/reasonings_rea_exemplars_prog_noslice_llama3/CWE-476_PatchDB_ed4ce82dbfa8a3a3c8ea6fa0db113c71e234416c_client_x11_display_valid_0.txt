Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because there is no check for a NULL pointer before accessing the `display` pointer in the `strlen` function. If `display` is NULL, dereferencing it in `strlen` will lead to a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability, which is CWE-476.
