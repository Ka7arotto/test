Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `length` is used to allocate memory for the `buf` array without checking if `length` is 0. If `length` is 0, then allocating memory for `buf` with `length` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
