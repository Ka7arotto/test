Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because there is no check for a NULL pointer before accessing the `src[i]` pointer in the loop. If `src` is NULL or any of its elements are NULL, dereferencing them to access `src[i].s` will lead to a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability, which is CWE-476.
