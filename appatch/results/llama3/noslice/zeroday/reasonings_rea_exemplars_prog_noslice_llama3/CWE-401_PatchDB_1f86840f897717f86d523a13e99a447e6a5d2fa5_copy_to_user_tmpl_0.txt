Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability does not exist in this code slice. The `memcpy` function at line 13 is not related to memory allocation or deallocation, and it does not cause a memory leak. The `memcpy` function is used to copy data from one memory location to another, and it does not allocate or deallocate memory. Therefore, there is no CWE-401 vulnerability in this code slice.
