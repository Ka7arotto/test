Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `memset` function is used with the `count` variable as the number of bytes to set, but there is no check to ensure that the `to` buffer has enough space to hold `count` bytes. If `count` is larger than the size of the `to` buffer, it will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
