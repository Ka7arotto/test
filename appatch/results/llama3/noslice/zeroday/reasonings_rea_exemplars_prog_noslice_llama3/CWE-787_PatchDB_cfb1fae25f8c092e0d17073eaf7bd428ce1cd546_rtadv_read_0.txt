Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the buffer `buf` is of fixed size `RTADV_MSG_SIZE`, and it is being filled by the `rtadv_recv_packet` function without checking if the received data length is within the buffer size. If the received data length is more than `RTADV_MSG_SIZE`, it will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
