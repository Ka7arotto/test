Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because there is no check for a NULL pointer before accessing the `pdata->board_flash_info` array in the line `flash_info = &pdata->board_flash_info[i];`. If `pdata` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `pdata->board_flash_info` will lead to a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability, which is CWE-476.
