Root Cause Analysis: There is no CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability at line 3, which is a simple variable declaration. The variables `i` and `j` are declared as `int`, which is a signed integer type, but there is no operation that can lead to an integer overflow or wraparound in this line. The vulnerability might exist elsewhere in the code, but it is not in this line.
