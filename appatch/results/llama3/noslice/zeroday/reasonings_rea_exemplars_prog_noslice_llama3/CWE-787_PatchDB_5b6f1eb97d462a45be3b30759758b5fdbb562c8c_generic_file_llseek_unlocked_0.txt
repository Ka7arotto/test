Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `file->f_pos` is added to `offset` without checking if `offset` can hold the result of the addition. If `offset` is close to the maximum value of `loff_t` and `file->f_pos` is large enough, the addition will result in an overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
