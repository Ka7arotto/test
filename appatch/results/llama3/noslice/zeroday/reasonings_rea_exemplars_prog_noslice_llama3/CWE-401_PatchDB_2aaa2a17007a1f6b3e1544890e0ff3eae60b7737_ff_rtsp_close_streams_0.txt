Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability does not exist in the code at line 16. The code seems to be properly releasing resources and closing streams. The `av_free` function is used to free the allocated memory, and `av_close_input_stream` is used to close the input stream. The `rt->asf_ctx` is set to `NULL` after closing the input stream, which is a good practice to prevent further usage of the closed stream. The code appears to be correctly releasing resources, and there is no memory leak or resource leak identified in this code slice.
