Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the `length` variable is of type `int`, which is a signed integer type. If a large value is assigned to `length`, it can lead to an integer overflow when used in subsequent operations, causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
