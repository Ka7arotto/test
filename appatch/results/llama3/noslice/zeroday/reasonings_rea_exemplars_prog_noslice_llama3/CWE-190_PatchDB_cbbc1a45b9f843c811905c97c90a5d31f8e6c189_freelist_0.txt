Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability does not exist in the code because the `int i` declaration itself does not have any potential for integer overflow or wraparound. The variable `i` is declared as an `int` type, which is a signed integer type, but it is not being used in a way that could lead to an integer overflow or wraparound. The vulnerability might exist elsewhere in the code, but not in this specific line.
