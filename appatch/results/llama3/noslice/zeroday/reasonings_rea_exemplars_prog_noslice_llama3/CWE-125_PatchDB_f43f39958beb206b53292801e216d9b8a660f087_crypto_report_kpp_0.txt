Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlcpy` function does not check if the destination buffer `rkpp.type` is large enough to hold the source string "kpp". If the buffer size is smaller than the source string length, it will lead to a buffer overflow, which is CWE-125.
