Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `block` is used to access the `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg` array without proper bounds checking. If `block` is negative, or greater than or equal to the size of the `retune_mobile_cfg` array, it will lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.
