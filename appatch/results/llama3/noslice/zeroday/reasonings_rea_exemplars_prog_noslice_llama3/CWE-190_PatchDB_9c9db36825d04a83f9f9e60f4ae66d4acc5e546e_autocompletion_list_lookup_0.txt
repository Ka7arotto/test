Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlen` function returns a `size_t` type, which is an unsigned integer type. However, in most systems, `size_t` is larger than `unsigned int`. If the length of the string `str` is large enough, it can cause an integer overflow when assigned to the `unsigned int` variable `str_len`, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
