Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `len` is used to access the `buf` array without checking if `len` is within the bounds of the `buf` array. If `len` is equal to `maxlen - 1`, then accessing `buf[len]` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
