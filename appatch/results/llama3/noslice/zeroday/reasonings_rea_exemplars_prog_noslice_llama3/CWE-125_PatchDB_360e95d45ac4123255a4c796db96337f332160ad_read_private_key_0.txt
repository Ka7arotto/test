Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `file->size` is used to read data from the file without proper validation. If `file->size` is larger than the actual file size or points to an invalid memory location, it will lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The `sc_file_get_acl_entry` function should ensure that the `file` object is valid and the `size` member is within the valid range.
