Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the `arg` parameter is of type `unsigned long`, which can hold a large value. When multiplied by `HZ` (which is presumably a large constant), it can lead to an integer overflow when divided by 1000, causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
