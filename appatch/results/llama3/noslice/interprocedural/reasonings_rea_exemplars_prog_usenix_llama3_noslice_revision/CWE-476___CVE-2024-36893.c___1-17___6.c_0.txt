To analyze the given code slice for the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability, let's break down the potential vulnerable behavior step by step, starting with the input to the function `typec_partner_register_altmode`.

### 1: Input Validation
- The function `typec_partner_register_altmode` takes two parameters: `partner` of type `struct typec_partner *` and `desc` of type `const struct typec_altmode_desc *`.
- The function calls `typec_register_altmode` with `&partner->dev` and `desc` as arguments.
- The potential vulnerability arises if either `partner` or `desc` (or both) is `NULL`, or if `partner->dev` is `NULL`.

### 2: NULL Pointer Dereference
- If `partner` is `NULL`, then attempting to access `partner->dev` will result in a NULL pointer dereference.
- Similarly, if `partner` is not `NULL` but `partner->dev` is `NULL`, passing `&partner->dev` to `typec_register_altmode` could lead to a NULL pointer dereference within that function.
- The function does not explicitly check for `NULL` before accessing or passing these pointers.

### 3: Potential Vulnerability
- The vulnerability occurs because there is no validation to ensure that `partner`, `partner->dev`, or `desc` is not `NULL` before they are used.
- This lack of validation means that if any of these pointers are `NULL`, the program will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to undefined behavior, typically resulting in a segmentation fault or crash.

### Conclusion:
The vulnerable behavior in this code is a NULL pointer dereference. It occurs because the function `typec_partner_register_altmode` does not validate its inputs (`partner` and `desc`) or the `dev` member of the `partner` structure to ensure they are not `NULL` before using them. To fix this vulnerability, the function should check for `NULL` pointers before attempting to access or pass them to other functions. For example:

```c
struct typec_altmode *
typec_partner_register_altmode(struct typec_partner *partner,
                               const struct typec_altmode_desc *desc)
{
    if (!partner || !partner->dev || !desc) {
        // Handle the error, e.g., return an error code or NULL
        return NULL;
    }
    return typec_register_altmode(&partner->dev, desc);
}
```

This check ensures that the function does not attempt to dereference a NULL pointer, preventing the CWE-476 vulnerability.
