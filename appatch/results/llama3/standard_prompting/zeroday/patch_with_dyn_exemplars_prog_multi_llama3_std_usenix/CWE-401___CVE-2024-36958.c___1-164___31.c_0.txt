Step 1:  CWE-401 vulnerability is a "" vulnerability. However, in this specific code slice, the vulnerability is not immediately apparent. 

The root cause of the vulnerability is likely due to the fact that the `ignore_crossmnt` variable is being assigned a boolean value based on the result of the comparison `ignore_crossmnt != 0`. 

However, the issue arises because `ignore_crossmnt` is an integer, and it's being compared to 0. If `ignore_crossmnt` is a pointer that has been freed or is a dangling pointer, this comparison will not result in a segmentation fault or any other immediate error. 

Instead, the comparison will simply evaluate to a boolean value (0 or 1), which will then be assigned to `args.ignore_crossmnt`. This can lead to unexpected behavior later in the code, potentially causing a use-after-free vulnerability.

The correct fix would be to ensure that `ignore_crossmnt` is a valid integer value before performing the comparison. If `ignore_crossmnt` is supposed to be a pointer, it should be checked for NULL before being dereferenced.

Here's an example of how the code could be fixed:

```c
31 	if (ignore_crossmnt != NULL) {
32 		args.ignore_crossmnt = 1;
33 	} else {
34 		args.ignore_crossmnt = 0;
35 	}
```

Or, if `ignore_crossmnt` is supposed to be an integer:

```c
31 	if (ignore_crossmnt) {
32 		args.ignore_crossmnt = 1;
33 	} else {
34 		args.ignore_crossmnt = 0;
35 	}
```

However, without more context about the rest of the code and how `ignore_crossmnt` is being used, it's difficult to provide a more specific fix.
Here are five possible patches for the CWE-401 vulnerability:

**Patch 1: Check for NULL pointer**
```c
31  if (ignore_crossmnt != NULL) {
32      args.ignore_crossmnt = 1;
33  } else {
34      args.ignore_crossmnt = 0;
35  }
```
**Patch 2: Use a safe boolean assignment**
```c
31  args.ignore_crossmnt = !!ignore_crossmnt;
```
This patch uses the double-bang operator (`!!`) to convert the integer value of `ignore_crossmnt` to a boolean value (0 or 1).

**Patch 3: Use a conditional expression**
```c
31  args.ignore_crossmnt = (ignore_crossmnt != 0) ? 1 : 0;
```
This patch uses a conditional expression to assign a boolean value to `args.ignore_crossmnt` based on the value of `ignore_crossmnt`.

**Patch 4: Check for valid integer value**
```c
31  if (ignore_crossmnt >= 0) {
32      args.ignore_crossmnt = 1;
33  } else {
34      args.ignore_crossmnt = 0;
35  }
```
This patch checks if `ignore_crossmnt` is a valid integer value (i.e., not negative) before assigning a boolean value to `args.ignore_crossmnt`.

**Patch 5: Use a separate boolean variable**
```c
30  bool ignore_crossmnt_bool = (ignore_crossmnt != 0);
31  args.ignore_crossmnt = ignore_crossmnt_bool;
```
This patch introduces a separate boolean variable `ignore_crossmnt_bool` to hold the result of the comparison, and then assigns this value to `args.ignore_crossmnt`.

Note that without more context about the rest of the code and how `ignore_crossmnt` is being used, it's difficult to provide a more specific fix. These patches are just possible solutions to address the CWE-401 vulnerability.
