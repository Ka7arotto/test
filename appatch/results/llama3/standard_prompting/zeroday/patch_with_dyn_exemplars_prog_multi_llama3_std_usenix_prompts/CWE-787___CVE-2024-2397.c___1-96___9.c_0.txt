```
1 static int xan_huffman_decode(unsigned char *dest, int dest_len, const unsigned char *src, int src_len)
3     unsigned char byte = *src++;
5     const unsigned char *ptr = src + byte * 2;
6     int ptr_len = src_len - 1 - byte * 2;
9     GetBitContext gb;
10     init_get_bits(&gb, ptr, ptr_len * 8);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
10     init_get_bits(&gb, ptr, ptr_len * 8);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `ptr_len` may be less than 0. This can happen when `src_len` is less than or equal to `byte * 2 + 1`. When this happens, the `init_get_bits` function will write to memory with a negative length, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the variable `ptr_len` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `ptr_len` is less than 0 before calling the `init_get_bits` function. If `ptr_len` is less than 0, the function should return an error instead of attempting to write to memory with a negative length. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     GetBitContext gb;
<     init_get_bits(&gb, ptr, ptr_len * 8);
---
>     GetBitContext gb;
>     if (ptr_len < 0)
>     {
>         return AVERROR_INVALIDDATA;
>     }
>     init_get_bits(&gb, ptr, ptr_len * 8);
```

18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `bufsize` variable is not validated before being used in the `sc_read_binary` function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. 

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the `buf` array. This can be done by limiting `bufsize` to the minimum of `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	bufsize = file->size;
---
> 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```
This patch ensures that `bufsize` will never be larger than the size of the `buf` array, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 int read_file(struct sc_card *card, char *str_path, unsigned char **data, size_t *data_len)
3 	struct sc_path path;
4 	struct sc_file *file;

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `len` variable may be zero or negative if `file->size` is zero or negative. When this happens, the `realloc` function will fail or allocate a very small buffer, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the `len` variable cannot be zero or negative. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `file->size` is greater than zero before assigning it to `len`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	len = file ? file->size : 4096;
---
> 	len = file && file->size > 0 ? file->size : 4096;
```
This patch ensures that `len` will not be zero or negative, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
19         XRenderSetPictureFilter(dmxScreen->beDisplay, pPictPriv->pict, filter, params, nparams);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `nparams` may be less than 0 if the calculation `((XFixed *)stuff + client->req_len) - params` results in a negative value. When this happens, the function `XRenderSetPictureFilter` will receive an invalid `nparams` value, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the variable `nparams` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `nparams` is less than 0 before calling the `XRenderSetPictureFilter` function. If `nparams` is less than 0, return an error code `BadLength` to prevent the out-of-bounds write. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<         nparams = ((XFixed *)stuff + client->req_len) - params;
<         XRenderSetPictureFilter(dmxScreen->beDisplay, pPictPriv->pict, filter, params, nparams);
---
>         nparams = ((XFixed *)stuff + client->req_len) - params;
>         if (nparams < 0)
>         {
>             return BadLength;
>         }
>         XRenderSetPictureFilter(dmxScreen->beDisplay, pPictPriv->pict, filter, params, nparams);

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `unfrag_ip6hlen` may be less than 0 if `ip6_find_1stfragopt(skb, &prevhdr)` returns a negative value. When this happens, the pointer arithmetic in `fptr = (frag_hdr *)((u8 *)ipv6h + unfrag_ip6hlen);` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the variable `unfrag_ip6hlen` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `unfrag_ip6hlen` is less than 0 after calling `ip6_find_1stfragopt(skb, &prevhdr)`. If it is, return an error pointer immediately. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<             unfrag_ip6hlen = ip6_find_1stfragopt(skb, &prevhdr);
<             fptr = (frag_hdr *)((u8 *)ipv6h + unfrag_ip6hlen);

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
6         memset(to, *from, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `count` variable is not validated before being passed to the `memset` function. If `count` is negative, it will cause an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to validate the input `count` to ensure it is not negative. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `count` is less than 0 and handle the error accordingly. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     if (len == 1)
---
>     PERL_ARGS_ASSERT_REPEATCPY;
>     if (count < 0)
>     {
>         Perl_croak_nocontext("%s", PL_memory_wrap);
>     }
>     if (len == 1)

This patch adds a check for `count` being negative and handles the error by calling `Perl_croak_nocontext` if it is.
