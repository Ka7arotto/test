```
1 static struct pending_cmd *mgmt_pending_add(struct sock *sk, u16 opcode, struct hci_dev *hdev, void *data, u16 len)
3     struct pending_cmd *cmd;
4     cmd = kmalloc(sizeof(*cmd), GFP_KERNEL);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
4     cmd = kmalloc(sizeof(*cmd), GFP_KERNEL);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the kmalloc function does not initialize the allocated memory, which may lead to uninitialized memory being used. This can cause unexpected behavior, including out-of-bounds writes.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use kzalloc instead of kmalloc. kzalloc initializes the allocated memory to zero, which prevents the use of uninitialized memory. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     cmd = kmalloc(sizeof(*cmd), GFP_KERNEL);
---
>     cmd = kzalloc(sizeof(*cmd), GFP_KERNEL);
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
62 static int read_public_key(RSA *rsa)
64 	int r;
66 	sc_file_t *file;
67 	u8 buf[2048], *p = buf;
68 	size_t bufsize, keysize;
70 	r = select_app_df();
71 	if (r)
74 	r = sc_select_file(card, &path, &file);
75 	if (r) {
79 	bufsize = file->size;
81 	r = sc_read_binary(card, 0, buf, bufsize, 0);
1 int sc_read_binary(sc_card_t *card, unsigned int idx,
2 		   unsigned char *buf, size_t count, unsigned long *flags)
6 	int r;
8 	if (card == NULL || card->ops == NULL || buf == NULL) {
17 	if (card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary)   {
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `bufsize` variable is not validated before being used in the `sc_read_binary` function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. 

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the `buf` array. This can be done by limiting `bufsize` to the minimum of `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	bufsize = file->size;
---
> 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```
This patch ensures that `bufsize` never exceeds the size of the `buf` array, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 char *kobject_get_path(struct kobject *kobj, gfp_t gfp_mask)
3     char *path;
4     int len;
5     len = get_kobj_path_length(kobj);
6     path = kmalloc(len, gfp_mask);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
6     path = kmalloc(len, gfp_mask);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `len` returned by `get_kobj_path_length(kobj)` might be zero or a negative value. When this happens, the `kmalloc` function will allocate zero or a negative size of memory, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the `kmalloc` function is not called with a zero or negative size. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `len` is zero before calling `kmalloc`. If `len` is zero, the function should return `NULL` to avoid the vulnerability. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     len = get_kobj_path_length(kobj);
<     path = kmalloc(len, gfp_mask);
---
>     len = get_kobj_path_length(kobj);
>     if (len == 0)
>     {
>         return NULL;
>     }
>     path = kmalloc(len, gfp_mask);
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int rtadv_read(struct thread *thread)
3     int sock;
4     int len;
5     u_char buf[RTADV_MSG_SIZE];
10     sock = THREAD_FD(thread);
13     len = rtadv_recv_packet(sock, buf, BUFSIZ, &from, &ifindex, &hoplimit);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
13     len = rtadv_recv_packet(sock, buf, BUFSIZ, &from, &ifindex, &hoplimit);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the buffer `buf` has a fixed size of `RTADV_MSG_SIZE`, but the function `rtadv_recv_packet` is allowed to write up to `BUFSIZ` bytes into `buf`. If `BUFSIZ` is larger than `RTADV_MSG_SIZE`, this will cause a buffer overflow, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the function `rtadv_recv_packet` does not write more bytes into `buf` than it can hold. This can be done by passing the actual size of `buf` to the function instead of `BUFSIZ`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     len = rtadv_recv_packet(sock, buf, BUFSIZ, &from, &ifindex, &hoplimit);
---
>     len = rtadv_recv_packet(sock, buf, sizeof(buf), &from, &ifindex, &hoplimit);
```
This patch ensures that `rtadv_recv_packet` will not write more bytes into `buf` than it can hold, thus preventing the buffer overflow vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 void Perl_repeatcpy(register char *to, register const char *from, I32 len, register IV count)
4     if (len == 1)
6         memset(to, *from, count);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
6         memset(to, *from, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `count` variable is not validated before being passed to the `memset` function. If `count` is negative, it will cause an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to validate the input `count` to ensure it is not negative. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `count` is less than 0 and handle the error accordingly. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     if (len == 1)
---
>     PERL_ARGS_ASSERT_REPEATCPY;
>     if (count < 0)
>     {
>         Perl_croak_nocontext("%s", PL_memory_wrap);
>     }
>     if (len == 1)
```
This patch adds a check for `count` being negative and handles the error by calling `Perl_croak_nocontext` if it is.

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 int acpi_bus_generate_proc_event4(const char *device_class, const char *bus_id, u8 type, int data)
3     struct acpi_bus_event *event;
5     if (!event_is_open)

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
9     event = kmalloc(sizeof(acpi_bus_event), GFP_ATOMIC);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the kmalloc function does not initialize the allocated memory, which may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when the allocated memory is used without initialization.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use kzalloc instead of kmalloc to allocate and initialize the memory. kzalloc initializes the allocated memory to zero, which prevents out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     event = kmalloc(sizeof(acpi_bus_event), GFP_ATOMIC);
---
>     event = kzalloc(sizeof(acpi_bus_event), GFP_ATOMIC);
```

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
19 	dl = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function does not initialize the allocated memory, which may lead to uninitialized memory being accessed. This can cause an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the allocated memory is initialized. This can be done by replacing `kmalloc` with `kzalloc`, which initializes the allocated memory to zero. Therefore, the patch should be:

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 ssize_t o_stream_send(struct ostream *stream, const void *data, size_t size)
3     struct _ostream *_stream = stream->real_stream;
4     if (stream->closed)
8     return _stream->send(_stream, data, size);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
8     return _stream->send(_stream, data, size);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the function `_stream->send(_stream, data, size)` may write to the buffer pointed to by `data` without checking if `size` is zero. When `size` is zero, the function call will result in an out-of-bounds write, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to add a check to ensure that `size` is not zero before calling the `_stream->send(_stream, data, size)` function. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to return 0 if `size` is zero, avoiding the out-of-bounds write. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     }
<     return _stream->send(_stream, data, size);
---
>     }
>     if (size == 0)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     return _stream->send(_stream, data, size);
```
This patch ensures that the `_stream->send(_stream, data, size)` function is not called when `size` is zero, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
