which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `bufsize` variable is not validated before being used in the `sc_read_binary` function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. 

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the `buf` array. This can be done by limiting `bufsize` to the minimum of `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	bufsize = file->size;
---
> 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```
This patch ensures that `bufsize` never exceeds the size of the `buf` array, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int crypt_alloc_tfms(struct crypt_config *cc, char *ciphermode)
5     cc->tfms = kmalloc(cc->tfms_count * sizeof(crypto_skcipher *), GFP_KERNEL);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
5     cc->tfms = kmalloc(cc->tfms_count * sizeof(crypto_skcipher *), GFP_KERNEL);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the kmalloc function does not initialize the allocated memory, which may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability if the allocated memory is not properly initialized before use.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use kzalloc instead of kmalloc to ensure that the allocated memory is initialized to zero. This can prevent out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities by avoiding the use of uninitialized memory. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     cc->tfms = kmalloc(cc->tfms_count * sizeof(crypto_skcipher *), GFP_KERNEL);
---
>     cc->tfms = kzalloc(cc->tfms_count * sizeof(crypto_skcipher *), GFP_KERNEL);

Q: Given the following code slice:

9     if (s->end_chunked_post && !s->end_header)
11         err = http_read_header(h, &new_location);
12         if (err < 0)
17     if (s->chunksize >= 0)
19         if (!s->chunksize)

25                     if ((err = http_get_line(s, line, sizeof(line))) < 0)
31                 s->chunksize = strtoll(line, NULL, 16);
33                 if (!s->chunksize)```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
33                 if (!s->chunksize)
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `s->chunksize` may be set to a negative value if `strtoll(line, NULL, 16)` fails to parse the chunk size. When this happens, the subsequent code will not handle the error correctly, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the variable `s->chunksize` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `s->chunksize` is less than 0 and handle the error accordingly. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<                 if (!s->chunksize)
---
>                 if (s->chunksize < 0)
>                 {
>                     return AVERROR_INVALIDDATA;
>                 }
>                 if (!s->chunksize)
```
This patch adds a check for `s->chunksize < 0` and returns an error if it's true, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int ProcRenderSetPictureFilter(ClientPtr client)
4     PicturePtr pPicture;
5     int result;
6     xFixed *params;
7     int nparams;
8     char *name;
11     name = (char *)(stuff + 1);
12     params = (xFixed *)(name + pad_to_int32(stuff->nbytes));
13     nparams = ((xFixed *)stuff + client->req_len) - params;
14     result = SetPictureFilter(pPicture, name, stuff->nbytes, params, nparams);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
14     result = SetPictureFilter(pPicture, name, stuff->nbytes, params, nparams);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `nparams` may be less than 0 if the calculation `((xFixed *)stuff + client->req_len) - params` results in a negative value. When this happens, the function `SetPictureFilter` will receive an invalid `nparams` value, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the variable `nparams` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `nparams` is less than 0 before calling the `SetPictureFilter` function. If `nparams` is less than 0, return an error code `BadLength`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     nparams = ((xFixed *)stuff + client->req_len) - params;
<     result = SetPictureFilter(pPicture, name, stuff->nbytes, params, nparams);
---
>     nparams = ((xFixed *)stuff + client->req_len) - params;
>     if (nparams < 0)
>     {
>         return BadLength;
>     }
>     result = SetPictureFilter(pPicture, name, stuff->nbytes, params, nparams);
```
