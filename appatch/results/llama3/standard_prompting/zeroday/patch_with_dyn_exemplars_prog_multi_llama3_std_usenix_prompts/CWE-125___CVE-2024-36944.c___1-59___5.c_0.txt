```
1 static int wm8994_get_drc_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `drc` may be out of bounds when accessing `wm8994->drc_cfg[drc]`. This can happen if `wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name)` returns a value that is not a valid index for `wm8994->drc_cfg`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to validate the index `drc` before using it to access `wm8994->drc_cfg`. This can be done by checking if `drc` is within the valid range. If `drc` is invalid, the function should return an error. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
<     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
---
>     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (drc < 0)
>     {
>         return drc;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```
This patch ensures that `drc` is validated before using it to access `wm8994->drc_cfg`, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 s32 vvc_parse_picture_header(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, VVCSliceInfo *si)
3 	u32 pps_id;
5 	si->irap_or_gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "irap_or_gdr_pic");
6 	si->non_ref_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "non_ref_pic");
7 	if (si->irap_or_gdr_pic)
8 		si->gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "gdr_pic");
9 	if ((si->inter_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "inter_slice_allowed_flag")))
10 		si->intra_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "intra_slice_allowed_flag");
12 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
13 	if (pps_id >= 64)
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` may be out of bounds of the array `vvc->pps`. When this happens, the array access will exceed the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `pps_id` is within the bounds of the array `vvc->pps`. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `pps_id` is within the valid range. However, in this case, the patch is not correctly fixing the issue. The correct patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if (pps_id < 0 || pps_id >= 64)
```
The added condition `pps_id < 0` is to prevent negative indices, which would also cause an out-of-bounds access.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static void ecall(mrb_state *mrb, int i)
3     struct RProc *p;
7     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
7     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `i` may be less than 0. When this happens, the array access to `mrb->c->ensure[i]` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `i` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `i` is less than 0 before accessing the array `mrb->c->ensure[i]`. If `i` is less than 0, the function can return immediately to avoid the out-of-bounds read. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     struct RObject *exc;
<     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
---
>     struct RObject *exc;
>     if (i < 0)
>     {
>         return;
>     }
>     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 s32 hevc_parse_slice_segment(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, HEVCSliceInfo *si)
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
7 	s32 pps_id;
31 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
32 	if (pps_id >= 64)
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` can be greater than or equal to 64, which is the maximum valid index for the array `hevc->pps`. When this happens, the array access will exceed the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `pps_id` is within the valid range. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to check if `pps_id` is within the valid range. However, in this case, the patch is not correctly fixing the issue. The correct patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64) || (pps_id >= hevc->num_pps))
```
The added condition `pps_id >= hevc->num_pps` ensures that `pps_id` is within the valid range of the array `hevc->pps`.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
5 	s32 vps_id;
6 	HEVC_VPS *vps;
10 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
12 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` may be out of bounds when accessing the array `hevc->vps`. This happens when `vps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 16. When this happens, the array access will be out of bounds, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `vps_id` is within the bounds of the array `hevc->vps`. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to check for both lower and upper bounds of `vps_id`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```
This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the array `hevc->vps`, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
62 static int read_public_key(RSA *rsa)
64 	int r;
66 	sc_file_t *file;
67 	u8 buf[2048], *p = buf;
68 	size_t bufsize, keysize;
70 	r = select_app_df();
71 	if (r)
74 	r = sc_select_file(card, &path, &file);
75 	if (r) {
79 	bufsize = file->size;
81 	r = sc_read_binary(card, 0, buf, bufsize, 0);
1 int sc_read_binary(sc_card_t *card, unsigned int idx,
2 		   unsigned char *buf, size_t count, unsigned long *flags)
6 	int r;
8 	if (card == NULL || card->ops == NULL || buf == NULL) {
17 	if (card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary)   {
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `bufsize` variable is not validated before being used in the `sc_read_binary` function. Specifically, if `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array, it will cause an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when `sc_read_binary` tries to read `bufsize` bytes into the `buf` array.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the `buf` array. This can be done by limiting `bufsize` to the minimum of `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	bufsize = file->size;
---
> 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```
This patch ensures that `bufsize` will never be larger than the size of the `buf` array, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 BOOL glyph_cache_put(rdpGlyphCache* glyphCache, UINT32 id, UINT32 index, rdpGlyph* glyph)
3 	rdpGlyph* prevGlyph;
5 	if (id > 9)
11 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `index` may be out of bounds of the array `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries`. This happens when `index` is greater than `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number`. When this happens, the read from `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index]` will be out-of-bounds, causing a CWE-125 vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `index` is within the bounds of the array `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries`. This can be done by changing the condition in the if statement to check if `index` is greater than or equal to `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
---
> 	if (index >= glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
```
This patch ensures that the index `index` is within the bounds of the array, preventing the out-of-bounds read and CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 decrypt_response(struct sc_card *card, unsigned char *in, size_t inlen, unsigned char *out, size_t * out_len)

19 	if (0x01 == in[2] && 0x82 != in[1]) {
20 		cipher_len = in[1];
21 		i = 3;
23 	else if (0x01 == in[3] && 0x81 == in[1]) {

47 		cipher_len--;
49 	if (2 == cipher_len)
53 	*out_len = cipher_len - 2;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
53 	*out_len = cipher_len - 2;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the value of `cipher_len` is not checked before being used to calculate the value assigned to `*out_len`. If `cipher_len` is less than 2, the subtraction `cipher_len - 2` will result in an underflow, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the value of `cipher_len` is valid before using it for calculation. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `cipher_len` is at least 2 before performing the subtraction. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (2 == cipher_len)
---
> 	if (2 == cipher_len || *out_len < cipher_len - 2)
```
This patch ensures that the subtraction `cipher_len - 2` will not result in an underflow, thus preventing the CWE-125 vulnerability.
