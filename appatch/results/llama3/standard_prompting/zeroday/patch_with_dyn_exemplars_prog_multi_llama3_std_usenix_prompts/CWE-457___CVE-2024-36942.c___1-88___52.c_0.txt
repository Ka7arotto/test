which has a CWE-457 vulnerability at line:
```
30 }```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability exists in the code because the dynamically allocated memory `destination` is not freed after it is no longer needed. This causes a memory leak.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to free the dynamically allocated memory when it is no longer needed. This can be done by adding a `free(destination)` statement after the `strcpy(source, destination)` statement. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<     strcpy(source, destination);
---
>     strcpy(source, destination);
>     free(destination);
> }
```
This patch ensures that the dynamically allocated memory is freed, preventing a memory leak.

Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability exists in the code because the `stack` object is not freed after use. This causes a memory leak.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to free the `stack` object after use. This can be done by adding a `g_free(stack)` statement before the function returns. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<     g_free(c);
---
>     g_free(c);
>     g_free(stack);
> }
```
This patch ensures that the `stack` object is properly freed, preventing the memory leak.

which has a CWE-457 vulnerability at line:

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability exists in the code because when the `ioremap_cache` function fails, the allocated memory for `node` is not freed, causing a memory leak. This happens when `data` is `NULL` and `error` is set to `-ENXIO`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to free the allocated memory for `node` when an error occurs. This can be done by adding a `kfree(node)` statement before setting `error` to `-ENXIO`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<             {
<                 error = -ENXIO;
---
>             {
>                 kfree(node);
>                 error = -ENXIO;
```
This patch ensures that the allocated memory for `node` is freed when an error occurs, preventing a memory leak.

which has a CWE-457 vulnerability at line:
```
8     return 0;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Improper Release of Memory Before Removing Last Reference) vulnerability exists in the code because the memory allocated for `di` is not freed before the function returns. This causes a memory leak.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to release the memory allocated for `di` before the function returns. This can be done by adding a call to `kfree(di)` before the return statement. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<     power_supply_unregister(&di->bat);
<     return 0;
---
>     power_supply_unregister(&di->bat);
>     kfree(di);

This patch ensures that the memory allocated for `di` is properly released before the function returns, fixing the CWE-401 vulnerability.

Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability exists in the code because the `rtsp_st` object is not freed after it is used. This causes a memory leak.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to free the `rtsp_st` object after it is used. This can be done by adding a call to `av_free(rtsp_st)` after the `if (rtsp_st)` block. Therefore the patch should be:

Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Improper Release of Memory Before Removing Last Reference) vulnerability exists in the code because the memory allocated for `ri` is not freed before returning `NULL` at line 15. This leads to a memory leak.
