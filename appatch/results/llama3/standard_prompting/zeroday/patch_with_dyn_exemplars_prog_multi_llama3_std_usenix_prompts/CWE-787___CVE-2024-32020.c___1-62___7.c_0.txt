5 	struct videobuf_mapping *map;
6 	unsigned int first;
8 	unsigned long offset = vma->vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT;
10 	if (! (vma->vm_flags & VM_WRITE) || ! (vma->vm_flags & VM_SHARED))
14 	for (first = 0; first < VIDEO_MAX_FRAME; first++) {
15 		if (NULL == q->bufs[first])

23 	if (VIDEO_MAX_FRAME == first) {
30 	map = q->bufs[first]->map = kmalloc(sizeof(struct videobuf_mapping),GFP_KERNEL);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
30 	map = q->bufs[first]->map = kmalloc(sizeof(struct videobuf_mapping),GFP_KERNEL);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because kmalloc does not initialize the allocated memory, which may contain random values. If the allocated memory is not initialized, it may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. This is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the allocated memory is initialized. This can be done by replacing kmalloc with kzalloc, which initializes the allocated memory to zero. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	map = q->bufs[first]->map = kmalloc(sizeof(struct videobuf_mapping),GFP_KERNEL);
---
> 	map = q->bufs[first]->map = kzalloc(sizeof(struct videobuf_mapping),GFP_KERNEL);
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 ssize_t o_stream_send(struct ostream *stream, const void *data, size_t size)
3     struct _ostream *_stream = stream->real_stream;
4     if (stream->closed)
8     return _stream->send(_stream, data, size);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
8     return _stream->send(_stream, data, size);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the function `_stream->send(_stream, data, size)` may write to the buffer pointed to by `data` without checking if `size` is zero. When `size` is zero, the function call will result in an out-of-bounds write, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to add a check to ensure that `size` is not zero before calling the `_stream->send(_stream, data, size)` function. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to return 0 if `size` is zero, avoiding the out-of-bounds write. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     }
<     return _stream->send(_stream, data, size);
---
>     }
>     if (size == 0)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     return _stream->send(_stream, data, size);
```
This patch ensures that the `_stream->send(_stream, data, size)` function is not called when `size` is zero, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int kvaser_usb_leaf_flush_queue(struct kvaser_usb_net_priv *priv)
3 	struct kvaser_cmd *cmd;
6 	cmd = kmalloc(sizeof(*cmd), GFP_KERNEL);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
6 	cmd = kmalloc(sizeof(*cmd), GFP_KERNEL);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the kmalloc function does not initialize the allocated memory, which may lead to uninitialized memory access. This can cause unexpected behavior, including out-of-bounds writes.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use kzalloc instead of kmalloc. kzalloc initializes the allocated memory to zero, which prevents uninitialized memory access and out-of-bounds writes. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	cmd = kmalloc(sizeof(*cmd), GFP_KERNEL);
---
> 	cmd = kzalloc(sizeof(*cmd), GFP_KERNEL);
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 do_core_note(struct magic_set *ms, unsigned char *nbuf, uint32_t type,

32 		os_style = OS_STYLE_NETBSD;
35 	if (os_style != -1 && (*flags & FLAGS_DID_CORE_STYLE) == 0) {
36 		if (file_printf(ms, ", %s-style", os_style_names[os_style])
43 	switch (os_style) {
45 		if (type == NT_NETBSD_CORE_PROCINFO) {
47 			struct NetBSD_elfcore_procinfo pi;
48 			memset(&pi, 0, sizeof(pi));
49 			memcpy(&pi, nbuf + doff, descsz);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
49 			memcpy(&pi, nbuf + doff, descsz);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `descsz` may be larger than `sizeof(pi)`. When this happens, the buffer write to `pi` will overflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the number of bytes copied by `memcpy` does not exceed the size of the buffer `pi`. This can be done by limiting the number of bytes copied to the minimum of `descsz` and `sizeof(pi)`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 			memcpy(&pi, nbuf + doff, descsz);
---
> 			memcpy(&pi, nbuf + doff, MIN(descsz, sizeof(pi)));
```
This patch ensures that the `memcpy` operation does not write beyond the boundary of `pi`, thus preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int probe_common(struct virtio_device *vdev)
5     vi = kmalloc(sizeof(virtrng_info), GFP_KERNEL);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
5     vi = kmalloc(sizeof(virtrng_info), GFP_KERNEL);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the kmalloc function does not initialize the allocated memory, which may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability if the allocated memory is not properly initialized before use.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use kzalloc instead of kmalloc to allocate and initialize the memory. kzalloc initializes the allocated memory to zero, which prevents out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     vi = kmalloc(sizeof(virtrng_info), GFP_KERNEL);
---
>     vi = kzalloc(sizeof(virtrng_info), GFP_KERNEL);
```

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `bufsize` variable is not validated before being used in the `sc_read_binary` function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. 

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the `buf` array. This can be done by limiting `bufsize` to the minimum of `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	bufsize = file->size;
---
> 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```
This patch ensures that `bufsize` will never be larger than the size of the `buf` array, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
19 	dl = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function does not initialize the allocated memory, which may lead to uninitialized memory being accessed. This can cause an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the allocated memory is initialized. This can be done by replacing `kmalloc` with `kzalloc`, which initializes the allocated memory to zero. Therefore, the patch should be:

This patch ensures that the allocated memory is initialized, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int snd_usb_copy_string_desc(struct mixer_build *state, int index, char *buf, int maxlen)
3     int len = usb_string(state->chip->dev, index, buf, maxlen - 1);
4     buf[len] = 0;```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
4     buf[len] = 0;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the function `usb_string` may return a negative value, which is then used as an index to access the `buf` array. If `len` is negative, the buffer write to `buf` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to check if `len` is within the valid range before using it as an index. This can be done by adding a conditional check to ensure `len` is not negative before accessing the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     int len = usb_string(state->chip->dev, index, buf, maxlen - 1);
<     buf[len] = 0;
---
>     int len = usb_string(state->chip->dev, index, buf, maxlen - 1);
>     if (len < 0)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     buf[len] = 0;
```
This patch ensures that `len` is not negative before using it to access the `buf` array, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
