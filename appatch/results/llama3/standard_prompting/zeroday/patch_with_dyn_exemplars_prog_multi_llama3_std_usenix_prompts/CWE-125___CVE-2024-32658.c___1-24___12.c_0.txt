```
1 static s32 gf_media_vvc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
4 	s32 vps_id;
5 	VVC_VPS *vps;
9 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
10 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` may be less than 0. When this happens, the array access `vvc->vps[vps_id]` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `vps_id` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to avoid `vps_id` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```
This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the array `vvc->vps[vps_id]`, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 void gdImageFillToBorder (gdImagePtr im, int x, int y, int border, int color)
8 	if (border < 0) {
13 	if (!im->trueColor) {
14 		if ((color > (im->colorsTotal - 1)) || (border > (im->colorsTotal - 1)) || (color < 0)) {
20 	im->alphaBlendingFlag = 0;
22 	if (x >= im->sx) {
23 		x = im->sx - 1;
24 	} else if (x < 0) {
25 		x = 0;
27 	if (y >= im->sy) {
28 		y = im->sy - 1;
29 	} else if (y < 0) {
30 		y = 0;
33 	for (i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
34 		if (gdImageGetPixel(im, i, y) == border) {
37 		gdImageSetPixel(im, i, y, color);```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
37 		gdImageSetPixel(im, i, y, color);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `color` may be less than 0 when calling `gdImageSetPixel(im, i, y, color)`. This is because the function `gdImageFillToBorder` does not check if `color` is within the valid range before calling `gdImageSetPixel`. When `color` is less than 0, it will cause an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `color` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to avoid `color` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (border < 0) {
---
> 	if (border < 0 || color < 0) {
```
This patch ensures that the function `gdImageFillToBorder` checks if `color` is less than 0 and handles it properly, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int serdes_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
4 	struct serdes_ctrl *ctrl;
5 	unsigned int i;
6 	int ret;
8 	ctrl = devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*ctrl), GFP_KERNEL);
9 	if (!ctrl)
12 	ctrl->dev = &pdev->dev;
13 	ctrl->regs = syscon_node_to_regmap(pdev->dev.parent->of_node);
14 	if (IS_ERR(ctrl->regs))
17 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
18 		ret = serdes_phy_create(ctrl, i, &ctrl->phys[i]);
19 		if (ret)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		ret = serdes_phy_create(ctrl, i, &ctrl->phys[i]);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the loop counter `i` can reach the value of `SERDES_MAX` in the loop condition `i <= SERDES_MAX`. When `i` equals `SERDES_MAX`, the array `ctrl->phys` will be accessed out of its bounds, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the loop counter `i` cannot reach the value of `SERDES_MAX`. This can be done by changing the loop condition to `i < SERDES_MAX`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
---
> 	for (i = 0; i < SERDES_MAX; i++) {
```
This patch ensures that the array `ctrl->phys` is not accessed out of its bounds, thus fixing the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int wm8994_get_retune_mobile_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `block` may be out of bounds when accessing `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block]`. This can happen if `wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name)` returns a negative value or a value that is greater than or equal to the size of `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `block` is within the bounds of `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg`. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `block` is valid before accessing `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block]`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
<     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
---
>     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (block < 0)
>     {
>         return block;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```
This patch checks if `block` is negative, and if so, returns the error code. If `block` is non-negative, it proceeds to access `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block]`.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int crypto_report_akcipher(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3     struct crypto_report_akcipher rakcipher;
4     strlcpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
4     strlcpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bound read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlcpy` function does not guarantee null termination when the destination buffer is not large enough. This can lead to an out-of-bound read when the copied string is later used as a null-terminated string.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use a function that guarantees null termination, such as `strncpy`. This function will pad the remaining bytes with null characters if the source string is shorter than the specified length. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     strlcpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));
---
>     strncpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
5 	s32 vps_id;
6 	HEVC_VPS *vps;
10 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
12 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` may be out of bounds when accessing the array `hevc->vps`. This happens when `vps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 16. When this happens, the array access will be out of bounds, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `vps_id` is within the bounds of the array `hevc->vps`. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to check for both lower and upper bounds of `vps_id`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```
This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the array `hevc->vps`, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_media_vvc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
4 	s32 vps_id;
5 	VVC_VPS *vps;
9 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
10 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` may be less than 0. When this happens, the array access `vvc->vps[vps_id]` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `vps_id` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to avoid `vps_id` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```
This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the array `vvc->vps[vps_id]`, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 s32 hevc_parse_slice_segment(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, HEVCSliceInfo *si)
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
7 	s32 pps_id;
31 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
32 	if (pps_id >= 64)
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` can be greater than or equal to 64, which is the maximum valid index for the array `hevc->pps`. When this happens, the array access will exceed the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `pps_id` is within the valid range. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to check if `pps_id` is within the valid range. However, in this case, the patch is not correctly fixing the issue. The correct patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64) || (pps_id >= hevc->num_pps))
```
The added condition `pps_id >= hevc->num_pps` ensures that `pps_id` does not exceed the actual size of the `hevc->pps` array.

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
5 	strlcpy(rcipher.type, "cipher", sizeof(rcipher.type));
```
