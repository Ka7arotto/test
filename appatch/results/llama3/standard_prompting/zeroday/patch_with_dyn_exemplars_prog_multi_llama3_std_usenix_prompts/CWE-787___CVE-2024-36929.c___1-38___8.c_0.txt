```
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `bufsize` variable is not validated before being used in the `sc_read_binary` function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. 

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the `buf` array. This can be done by limiting `bufsize` to the minimum of `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	bufsize = file->size;
---
> 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```
This patch ensures that `bufsize` never exceeds the size of the `buf` array, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 char *kobject_get_path(struct kobject *kobj, gfp_t gfp_mask)
3     char *path;
4     int len;
5     len = get_kobj_path_length(kobj);
6     path = kmalloc(len, gfp_mask);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
6     path = kmalloc(len, gfp_mask);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `len` returned by `get_kobj_path_length(kobj)` might be zero or a negative value. When this happens, the `kmalloc` function will allocate zero or a negative size of memory, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the `kmalloc` function is not called with a zero or negative size. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `len` is zero before calling `kmalloc`. If `len` is zero, the function should return `NULL` to avoid the vulnerability. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     len = get_kobj_path_length(kobj);
<     path = kmalloc(len, gfp_mask);
---
>     len = get_kobj_path_length(kobj);
>     if (len == 0)
>     {
>         return NULL;
>     }
>     path = kmalloc(len, gfp_mask);
```
