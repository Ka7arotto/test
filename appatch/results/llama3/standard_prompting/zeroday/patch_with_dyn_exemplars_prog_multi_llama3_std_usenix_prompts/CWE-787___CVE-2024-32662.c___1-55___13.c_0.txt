which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `bufsize` variable is not validated before being used in the `sc_read_binary` function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. 

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the `buf` array. This can be done by limiting `bufsize` to the minimum of `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	bufsize = file->size;
---
> 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```
This patch ensures that `bufsize` will never be larger than the size of the `buf` array, preventing a potential buffer overflow.

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `count` parameter in the `sc_read_binary` function may exceed the size of the `buf` array, causing a buffer overflow. This can happen when `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the `count` parameter does not exceed the size of the `buf` array. This can be done by limiting the `bufsize` to the minimum of `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```

```
72             buf[buflen] = '\0';
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `buflen` may be less than or equal to 0 if `pg_mbcliplen(buf, l, l)` returns a value less than or equal to 0. When this happens, the buffer write to `buf` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `buflen` cannot be less than or equal to 0. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `buflen` is less than or equal to 0 before writing to `buf`. If `buflen` is less than or equal to 0, the function can return immediately to avoid the out-of-bounds write. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<             buflen = pg_mbcliplen(buf, l, l);
<             buf[buflen] = "\0";
---
>             buflen = pg_mbcliplen(buf, l, l);
>             if (buflen <= 0)
>             {
>                 return;
>             }
>             buf[buflen] = "\0";
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int snd_usb_copy_string_desc(struct mixer_build *state, int index, char *buf, int maxlen)
3     int len = usb_string(state->chip->dev, index, buf, maxlen - 1);
4     buf[len] = 0;```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
4     buf[len] = 0;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the function `usb_string` may return a negative value, which is then used as an index to access the `buf` array. If `len` is negative, the buffer write to `buf` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to check if `len` is within the valid range before using it as an index. This can be done by adding a conditional check to ensure `len` is not negative before accessing the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     int len = usb_string(state->chip->dev, index, buf, maxlen - 1);
<     buf[len] = 0;
---
>     int len = usb_string(state->chip->dev, index, buf, maxlen - 1);
>     if (len < 0)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     buf[len] = 0;
```
This patch ensures that `len` is not negative before using it to access the `buf` array, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

```
49 			memcpy(&pi, nbuf + doff, descsz);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `descsz` may be larger than `sizeof(pi)`. When this happens, the buffer write to `pi` will overflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the number of bytes copied by `memcpy` does not exceed the size of the buffer `pi`. This can be done by limiting the number of bytes copied to the minimum of `descsz` and `sizeof(pi)`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 			memcpy(&pi, nbuf + doff, descsz);
---
> 			memcpy(&pi, nbuf + doff, MIN(descsz, sizeof(pi)));
```
This patch ensures that the `memcpy` operation does not write beyond the boundary of `pi`, thus preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
