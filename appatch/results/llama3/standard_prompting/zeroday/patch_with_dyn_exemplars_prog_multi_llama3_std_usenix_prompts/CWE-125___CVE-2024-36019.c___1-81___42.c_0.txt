```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_sps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, u8 layer_id, u32 *vui_flag_pos)
6 	HEVC_VPS *vps;
14 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
15 	if (vps_id >= 16) {
31 	sps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "sps_id");
32 	if ((sps_id < 0) || (sps_id >= 16)) {
43 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
43 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` may be out of bounds when accessing the `hevc->vps` array. Specifically, if `vps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 16, it will cause an out-of-bounds access.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `vps_id` is within the valid range. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `vps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the `hevc->vps` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) {
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) {
```
This patch adds a check for `vps_id` being less than 0, which prevents the out-of-bounds access and fixes the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int serdes_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
4 	struct serdes_ctrl *ctrl;
5 	unsigned int i;
6 	int ret;
8 	ctrl = devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*ctrl), GFP_KERNEL);
9 	if (!ctrl)
12 	ctrl->dev = &pdev->dev;
13 	ctrl->regs = syscon_node_to_regmap(pdev->dev.parent->of_node);
14 	if (IS_ERR(ctrl->regs))
17 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
18 		ret = serdes_phy_create(ctrl, i, &ctrl->phys[i]);
19 		if (ret)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		ret = serdes_phy_create(ctrl, i, &ctrl->phys[i]);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the loop counter `i` can reach the value of `SERDES_MAX` in the loop condition `i <= SERDES_MAX`. When `i` equals `SERDES_MAX`, the array `ctrl->phys` will be accessed out of its bounds, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the loop counter `i` cannot reach the value of `SERDES_MAX`. This can be done by changing the loop condition to `i < SERDES_MAX`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
---
> 	for (i = 0; i < SERDES_MAX; i++) {
```
This patch ensures that the array `ctrl->phys` is not accessed out of its bounds, thus fixing the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 bit_write_MC (Bit_Chain *dat, BITCODE_MC val)
3   int i, j;
5   unsigned char byte[5];
6   BITCODE_UMC mask = 0x0000007f;
7   BITCODE_UMC value = (BITCODE_UMC)val;
9   if (val < 0)
12       value = (BITCODE_UMC)-val;
14   for (i = 4, j = 0; i >= 0; i--, j += 7)
16       byte[i] = (unsigned char)((value & mask) >> j);
17       byte[i] |= 0x80;
18       mask = mask << 7;
20   for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
21     if (byte[i] & 0x7f)
24   if (byte[i] & 0x40)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
24   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `i` may be less than 0 in the `for` loop. When this happens, the array `byte` will be accessed out of its boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `i` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the `if` statement to avoid `i` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
---
>   if (byte[i] & 0x40 && i > 0)
```
This patch ensures that the array `byte` is accessed within its boundary, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_media_vvc_read_pps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc)
4 	s32 pps_id;
5 	VVC_PPS *pps;
8 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 6, "pps_id");
10 	if ((pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64)) {
14 	pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];
16 	if (!pps->state) {
17 		pps->id = pps_id;
18 		pps->state = 1;
20 	pps->sps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "sps_id");
21 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
21 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `pps->sps_id` may be less than 0 if the `gf_bs_read_int_log` function returns a negative value. When this happens, the array access `vvc->pps[pps_id]` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `pps->sps_id` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to avoid `pps->sps_id` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
---
> 	if ((pps->sps_id<0) || (pps->sps_id >= 16)) {
```
This patch ensures that the `pps->sps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the array, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static __u8 *kye_report_fixup(struct hid_device *hdev, __u8 *rdesc,
2 		unsigned int *rsize)
4 	switch (hdev->product) {
13 		if (*rsize >= 74 &&
22 			rdesc[62] = 0x09;
23 			rdesc[64] = 0x04;
24 			rdesc[66] = 0x07;
25 			rdesc[72] = 0x01;
26 			rdesc[74] = 0x08;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
26 			rdesc[74] = 0x08;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `74` is out of bounds when `*rsize` is `74`. This is because in C, arrays are zero-based, so the maximum valid index for an array of size `*rsize` is `*rsize - 1`. When `*rsize` is `74`, the maximum valid index is `73`, and accessing `rdesc[74]` is out of bounds.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index does not exceed the valid bounds. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to avoid `*rsize` being equal to `74`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 		if (*rsize >= 74 &&
---
> 		if (*rsize >= 75 &&
```
This patch ensures that `*rsize` is at least `75`, making the index `74` a valid access.

23   byte[i] &= 0x7f;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `i` may be less than 0 if the condition `byte[i] & 0x40` is true. When this happens, the array access `byte[i]` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.
