```
1 static int crypto_report_cipher(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3     struct crypto_report_cipher rcipher;
4     strlcpy(rcipher.type, "cipher", sizeof(rcipher.type));```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
4     strlcpy(rcipher.type, "cipher", sizeof(rcipher.type));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bound read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlcpy` function does not guarantee null termination when the destination buffer is not large enough. This can lead to an out-of-bound read when the string is later used.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use a function that guarantees null termination, such as `strncpy`. This function will pad the remaining bytes with null characters if the source string is shorter than the destination buffer size. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     strlcpy(rcipher.type, "cipher", sizeof(rcipher.type));
---
>     strncpy(rcipher.type, "cipher", sizeof(rcipher.type));
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static struct phy *serdes_simple_xlate(struct device *dev,
2 				       struct of_phandle_args *args)
4 	struct serdes_ctrl *ctrl = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
5 	unsigned int port, idx, i;
7 	if (args->args_count != 2)
11 	idx = args->args[1];
13 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
14 		struct serdes_macro *macro = phy_get_drvdata(ctrl->phys[i]);
16 		if (idx != macro->idx)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 		struct serdes_macro *macro = phy_get_drvdata(ctrl->phys[i]);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `i` can reach up to `SERDES_MAX` in the `for` loop. When `i` equals `SERDES_MAX`, it may exceed the boundary of the `ctrl->phys` array, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `i` cannot exceed the boundary of the `ctrl->phys` array. This can be done by changing the loop condition to `i < SERDES_MAX` to avoid `i` reaching `SERDES_MAX`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
---
> 	for (i = 0; i < SERDES_MAX; i++) {
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 s32 vvc_parse_picture_header(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, VVCSliceInfo *si)
3 	u32 pps_id;
5 	si->irap_or_gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "irap_or_gdr_pic");
6 	si->non_ref_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "non_ref_pic");
7 	if (si->irap_or_gdr_pic)
8 		si->gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "gdr_pic");
9 	if ((si->inter_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "inter_slice_allowed_flag")))
10 		si->intra_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "intra_slice_allowed_flag");
12 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
13 	if (pps_id >= 64)
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` may be out of bounds of the array `vvc->pps`. When this happens, the array access will exceed the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `pps_id` is within the bounds of the array `vvc->pps`. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `pps_id` is within the valid range. However, in this case, the patch is not correctly fixing the issue. The correct patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if (pps_id < 0 || pps_id >= 64)
```
The added condition `pps_id < 0` is to prevent negative indices, which would also cause an out-of-bounds access.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int crypto_report_comp(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3     struct crypto_report_comp rcomp;

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
4     strlcpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bound read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlcpy` function does not guarantee null termination when the destination buffer is not large enough.

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
5 	s32 vps_id;
6 	HEVC_VPS *vps;
10 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
12 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` may be out of bounds when accessing the array `hevc->vps`. This happens when `vps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 16. When this happens, the array access will be out of bounds, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `vps_id` is within the bounds of the array `hevc->vps`. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to check for both lower and upper bounds of `vps_id`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```
This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the array `hevc->vps`, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int crypto_report_comp(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3 	struct crypto_report_comp rcomp;
5 	strlcpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
5 	strlcpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bound read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlcpy` function does not guarantee null-termination of the destination string when the source string is longer than the specified size. This can lead to an out-of-bound read vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use a function that guarantees null-termination of the destination string. In this case, `strncpy` can be used instead of `strlcpy` to ensure that the destination string `rcomp.type` is null-terminated. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	strlcpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));
---
> 	strncpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));
```


Q: Given the following code slice:

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
24   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `i` may be less than 0 in the `for` loop. When this happens, the array `byte` will be accessed out of its boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `i` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the `if` statement to avoid `i` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
---
>   if (byte[i] & 0x40 && i > 0)
```
This patch ensures that the array `byte` is accessed within its boundary, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 s32 hevc_parse_slice_segment(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, HEVCSliceInfo *si)
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
7 	s32 pps_id;
31 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
32 	if (pps_id >= 64)
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` can be greater than or equal to 64, which is the maximum valid index for the array `hevc->pps`. When this happens, the array access will exceed the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `pps_id` is within the valid range. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to check if `pps_id` is within the valid range. However, in this case, the patch is not correctly fixing the issue. The correct patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64) || (pps_id >= hevc->num_pps))
```
The added condition `pps_id >= hevc->num_pps` ensures that `pps_id` does not exceed the actual size of the `hevc->pps` array.
