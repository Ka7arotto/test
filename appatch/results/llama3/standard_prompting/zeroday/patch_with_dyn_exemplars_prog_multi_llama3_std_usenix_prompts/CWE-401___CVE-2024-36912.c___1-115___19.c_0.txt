```
1 static long nvm_ioctl_get_devices(struct file *file, void __user *arg)
3     struct nvm_ioctl_get_devices *devices;
4     struct nvm_dev *dev;
5     int i = 0;
6     if (!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
8         return -EPERM;
10     devices = kzalloc(sizeof(nvm_ioctl_get_devices), GFP_KERNEL);
11     if (!devices)
13         return -ENOMEM;
15     down_write(&nvm_lock);
16     list_for_each_entry(, , )
18         struct nvm_ioctl_device_info *info = &devices->info[i];
19         sprintf(info->devname, "%s", dev->name);
20         if (dev->mt)
22             info->bmversion[0] = dev->mt->version[0];
23             info->bmversion[1] = dev->mt->version[1];
24             info->bmversion[2] = dev->mt->version[2];
25             sprintf(info->bmname, "%s", dev->mt->name);
29             sprintf(info->bmname, "none");
31         i++;
32         if (i > 31)
38     up_write(&nvm_lock);
39     devices->nr_devices = i;
40     if (copy_to_user(arg, devices, sizeof(nvm_ioctl_get_devices)))
42         return -EFAULT;
44     kfree(devices);
45     return 0;```
which has a CWE-401 vulnerability at line:
```
43     }
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Improper Release of Memory Before Removing Last Reference) vulnerability exists in the code because the memory allocated for `devices` is not freed when an error occurs in the `copy_to_user` function. This leads to a memory leak.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the memory is released before returning from the function. This can be done by adding a call to `kfree(devices)` before returning `-EFAULT`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     {
<         return -EFAULT;
---
>     {
>         kfree(devices);
>         return -EFAULT;
```
This patch ensures that the memory allocated for `devices` is freed before returning from the function, preventing a memory leak.
