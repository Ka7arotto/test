```
1 s32 vvc_parse_picture_header(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, VVCSliceInfo *si)
3 	u32 pps_id;
5 	si->irap_or_gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "irap_or_gdr_pic");

9 	if ((si->inter_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "inter_slice_allowed_flag")))
10 		si->intra_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "intra_slice_allowed_flag");
12 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
13 	if (pps_id >= 64)
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` may be out of bounds of the array `vvc->pps`. When this happens, the array access will exceed the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `pps_id` is within the bounds of the array `vvc->pps`. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `pps_id` is within the valid range. However, in this case, the patch is not correctly fixing the issue. The correct patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if (pps_id < 0 || pps_id >= 64)
```
The added condition `pps_id < 0` is to prevent negative indices, which would also cause an out-of-bounds access.

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static __u8 *sp_report_fixup(struct hid_device *hdev, __u8 *rdesc,
2 		unsigned int *rsize)
4 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
7 		rdesc[105] = rdesc[110] = 0x03;
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the array `rdesc` is accessed with an index of 111, but the condition only checks if `*rsize` is greater than or equal to 107. This means that if `*rsize` is 107, 108, 109, 110, or 111, the access to `rdesc[111]` will be out-of-bounds, causing a CWE-125 vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index does not exceed the valid range. This can be done by increasing the condition to check if `*rsize` is greater than or equal to the maximum index used, which is 112 in this case. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
---
> 	if (*rsize >= 112 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
```

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 bit_write_UMC (Bit_Chain *dat, BITCODE_UMC val)
3   int i, j;
5   unsigned char byte[5];
6   BITCODE_UMC mask;
7   BITCODE_UMC value;
9   value = val;
10   mask = 0x0000007f;
11   for (i = 4, j = 0; i >= 0; i--, j += 7)
13       byte[i] = (unsigned char)((value & mask) >> j);
14       byte[i] |= 0x80;
15       mask = mask << 7;
17   for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
18     if (byte[i] & 0x7f)
21   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
22     i--;
23   byte[i] &= 0x7f;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
23   byte[i] &= 0x7f;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `i` may be less than 0 if the condition `byte[i] & 0x40` is true. When this happens, the array access `byte[i]` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `i` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to avoid `i` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
---
>   if (byte[i] & 0x40 && i > 0)
```
This patch ensures that the array access `byte[i]` will not underflow the boundary, thus fixing the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_sps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, u8 layer_id, u32 *vui_flag_pos)
6 	HEVC_VPS *vps;
14 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
15 	if (vps_id >= 16) {
31 	sps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "sps_id");
32 	if ((sps_id < 0) || (sps_id >= 16)) {
43 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
43 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` may be out of bounds when accessing the `hevc->vps` array. Specifically, if `vps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 16, it will cause an out-of-bounds access.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `vps_id` is within the valid range. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `vps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the `hevc->vps` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) {
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) {
```
This patch adds a check for `vps_id` being less than 0, which prevents the out-of-bounds access and fixes the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int drxj_dap_atomic_read_reg32(struct i2c_device_addr *dev_addr, u32 addr, u32 *data, u32 flags)
3     u8 buf[sizeof(*data)];
6     if (!data)
11     word = (u32)buf[3];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
11     word = (u32)buf[3];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the buffer `buf` is not checked for its size before accessing its 4th element (`buf[3]`). If the size of `buf` is less than 4, accessing `buf[3]` will result in an out-of-bounds read, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the buffer `buf` has a sufficient size before accessing its elements. In this case, the function `drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block` is called, which presumably fills the buffer `buf`. However, the return code `rc` is not checked. If the function call fails, the buffer `buf` may not be properly initialized, leading to an out-of-bounds read. Therefore, the patch should check the return code `rc` before accessing the buffer `buf`. The corrected code is:
```
<     rc = drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block(dev_addr, addr, sizeof(*data), buf, true);
<     word = (u32)buf[3];
---
>     rc = drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block(dev_addr, addr, sizeof(*data), buf, true);
>     if (rc < 0)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     word = (u32)buf[3];
```
This patch ensures that the buffer `buf` is properly initialized before accessing its elements, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 bit_write_MC (Bit_Chain *dat, BITCODE_MC val)
3   int i, j;
5   unsigned char byte[5];
6   BITCODE_UMC mask = 0x0000007f;
7   BITCODE_UMC value = (BITCODE_UMC)val;
9   if (val < 0)
12       value = (BITCODE_UMC)-val;
14   for (i = 4, j = 0; i >= 0; i--, j += 7)
16       byte[i] = (unsigned char)((value & mask) >> j);
17       byte[i] |= 0x80;
18       mask = mask << 7;
20   for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
21     if (byte[i] & 0x7f)
24   if (byte[i] & 0x40)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
24   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `i` may be less than 0 in the `for` loop. When this happens, the array `byte` will be accessed out of its boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `i` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the `if` statement to avoid `i` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
---
>   if (byte[i] & 0x40 && i > 0)
```
This patch ensures that the array `byte` is accessed within its boundary, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int wm8994_get_drc_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `drc` may be out of bounds when accessing `wm8994->drc_cfg[drc]`. This can happen if `wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name)` returns a value that is not a valid index for `wm8994->drc_cfg`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to validate the index `drc` before using it to access `wm8994->drc_cfg`. This can be done by checking if `drc` is within the valid range. If `drc` is invalid, the function should return an error. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
<     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
---
>     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (drc < 0)
>     {
>         return drc;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```
This patch ensures that `drc` is validated before using it to access `wm8994->drc_cfg`, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
