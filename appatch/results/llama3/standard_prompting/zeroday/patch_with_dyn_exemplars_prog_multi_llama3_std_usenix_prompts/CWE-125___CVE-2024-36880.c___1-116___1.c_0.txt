```
1 s32 hevc_parse_slice_segment(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, HEVCSliceInfo *si)
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
7 	s32 pps_id;
31 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
32 	if (pps_id >= 64)
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` can be greater than or equal to 64, which is the maximum valid index for the array `hevc->pps`. When this happens, the array access will exceed the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `pps_id` is within the valid range. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to check if `pps_id` is within the valid range. However, in this case, the patch is not correctly fixing the issue. The correct patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64) || (pps_id >= hevc->num_pps))
```
The added condition `pps_id >= hevc->num_pps` ensures that `pps_id` is within the valid range of the array `hevc->pps`.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 BOOL glyph_cache_put(rdpGlyphCache* glyphCache, UINT32 id, UINT32 index, rdpGlyph* glyph)
3 	rdpGlyph* prevGlyph;
5 	if (id > 9)
11 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `index` may be out of bounds of the array `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries`. This happens when `index` is greater than `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number`. When this happens, the read from `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index]` will be out-of-bounds, causing a CWE-125 vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `index` is within the bounds of the array `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries`. This can be done by changing the condition in the if statement to check if `index` is greater than or equal to `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
---
> 	if (index >= glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
```
This patch ensures that the index `index` is within the bounds of the array, preventing the out-of-bounds read and CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int serdes_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
4 	struct serdes_ctrl *ctrl;
5 	unsigned int i;
6 	int ret;
8 	ctrl = devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*ctrl), GFP_KERNEL);
9 	if (!ctrl)
12 	ctrl->dev = &pdev->dev;
13 	ctrl->regs = syscon_node_to_regmap(pdev->dev.parent->of_node);
14 	if (IS_ERR(ctrl->regs))
17 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
18 		ret = serdes_phy_create(ctrl, i, &ctrl->phys[i]);
19 		if (ret)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		ret = serdes_phy_create(ctrl, i, &ctrl->phys[i]);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the loop counter `i` can reach the value of `SERDES_MAX` in the loop condition `i <= SERDES_MAX`. When `i` equals `SERDES_MAX`, the array `ctrl->phys` will be accessed out of its bounds, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the loop counter `i` cannot reach the value of `SERDES_MAX`. This can be done by changing the loop condition to `i < SERDES_MAX`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
---
> 	for (i = 0; i < SERDES_MAX; i++) {
```
This patch ensures that the array `ctrl->phys` is not accessed out of its bounds, thus fixing the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int crypto_report_kpp(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3     struct crypto_report_kpp rkpp;
4     strlcpy(rkpp.type, "kpp", sizeof(rkpp.type));```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
4     strlcpy(rkpp.type, "kpp", sizeof(rkpp.type));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bound read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlcpy` function does not guarantee null termination when the destination buffer is not large enough. This can lead to an out-of-bound read when the string is later used.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use a function that guarantees null termination, such as `strncpy`. This function will pad the remaining buffer with null characters, ensuring that the string is properly terminated. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     strlcpy(rkpp.type, "kpp", sizeof(rkpp.type));
---
>     strncpy(rkpp.type, "kpp", sizeof(rkpp.type));
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int wm8994_get_drc_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `drc` may be out of bounds when accessing `wm8994->drc_cfg[drc]`. This can happen if `wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name)` returns a value that is not a valid index for `wm8994->drc_cfg`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to validate the index `drc` before using it to access `wm8994->drc_cfg`. This can be done by checking if `drc` is within the valid range. If `drc` is invalid, the function should return an error. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
<     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
---
>     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (drc < 0)
>     {
>         return drc;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```
This patch ensures that `drc` is validated before using it to access `wm8994->drc_cfg`, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int crypto_report_akcipher(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3 	struct crypto_report_akcipher rakcipher;
5 	strlcpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
5 	strlcpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bound read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlcpy` function does not guarantee null termination when the destination buffer is not large enough. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read when the copied string is later used as a null-terminated string.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use a function that guarantees null termination, such as `strncpy`. This function will pad the remaining bytes with null characters if the source string is shorter than the specified length. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	strlcpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));
---
> 	strncpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 bit_write_MC (Bit_Chain *dat, BITCODE_MC val)
3   int i, j;
5   unsigned char byte[5];
6   BITCODE_UMC mask = 0x0000007f;
7   BITCODE_UMC value = (BITCODE_UMC)val;
9   if (val < 0)
12       value = (BITCODE_UMC)-val;
14   for (i = 4, j = 0; i >= 0; i--, j += 7)
16       byte[i] = (unsigned char)((value & mask) >> j);
17       byte[i] |= 0x80;
18       mask = mask << 7;
20   for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
21     if (byte[i] & 0x7f)
24   if (byte[i] & 0x40)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
24   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `i` may be less than 0 in the `for` loop. When this happens, the array `byte` will be accessed out of its boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `i` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the `if` statement to avoid `i` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
---
>   if (byte[i] & 0x40 && i > 0)
```
This patch ensures that the array `byte` is accessed within its boundary, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_media_vvc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
4 	s32 vps_id;
5 	VVC_VPS *vps;
9 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
10 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` may be less than 0. When this happens, the array access `vvc->vps[vps_id]` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `vps_id` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to avoid `vps_id` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```
This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the array `vvc->vps[vps_id]`, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static __u8 *sp_report_fixup(struct hid_device *hdev, __u8 *rdesc,
2 		unsigned int *rsize)
4 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
7 		rdesc[105] = rdesc[110] = 0x03;
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the array `rdesc` is accessed with an index of 111, but the condition only checks if `*rsize` is greater than or equal to 107. This means that if `*rsize` is 107, 108, 109, 110, or 111, the access to `rdesc[111]` will be out-of-bounds, causing a CWE-125 vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index does not exceed the valid range. This can be done by increasing the condition to check if `*rsize` is greater than or equal to the maximum index used, which is 112 in this case. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
---
> 	if (*rsize >= 112 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
```
