which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
72             buf[buflen] = '\0';
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `buflen` may be less than or equal to 0 if `pg_mbcliplen(buf, l, l)` returns a value less than or equal to 0. When this happens, the buffer write to `buf` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `buflen` cannot be less than or equal to 0. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `buflen` is less than or equal to 0 before writing to `buf`. If `buflen` is less than or equal to 0, the function can return immediately to avoid the out-of-bounds write. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<             buflen = pg_mbcliplen(buf, l, l);
<             buf[buflen] = "\0";
---
>             buflen = pg_mbcliplen(buf, l, l);
>             if (buflen <= 0)
>             {
>                 return;
>             }
>             buf[buflen] = "\0";
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
62 static int read_public_key(RSA *rsa)

71 	if (r)
74 	r = sc_select_file(card, &path, &file);
75 	if (r) {

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `bufsize` variable is not validated before being used in the `sc_read_binary` function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. 

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the `buf` array. This can be done by limiting `bufsize` to the minimum of `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	bufsize = file->size;
---
> 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```
This patch ensures that `bufsize` never exceeds the size of the `buf` array, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

```
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `count` parameter in the `sc_read_binary` function may exceed the size of the `buf` array, causing a buffer overflow. This can happen when `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the `count` parameter does not exceed the size of the `buf` array. This can be done by limiting the `bufsize` to the minimum of `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	bufsize = file->size;
---
> 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```
This patch ensures that the `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the `buf` array, preventing the buffer overflow vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int btrfs_extent_same(struct inode *src, u64 loff, u64 len, struct inode *dst, u64 dst_loff)
4     if (src == dst)
8     btrfs_double_lock(src, loff, dst, dst_loff, len);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
8     btrfs_double_lock(src, loff, dst, dst_loff, len);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `len` parameter may be zero, which can cause an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when passed to the `btrfs_double_lock` function.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the `len` parameter is not zero before calling the `btrfs_double_lock` function. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `len` is zero and return immediately if it is. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     }
<     btrfs_double_lock(src, loff, dst, dst_loff, len);
---
>     }
>     if (len == 0)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     btrfs_double_lock(src, loff, dst, dst_loff, len);
```
This patch ensures that the `btrfs_double_lock` function is not called with a zero `len` parameter, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
148         return put_user(len, optlen);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `put_user` function may write to `optlen` with a negative value of `len`. This can cause an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the `put_user` function is not called with a negative value of `len`. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `len` is less than 0 before calling `put_user`. If `len` is less than 0, the function should return the error code directly. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<         release_sock(sk);
<         return put_user(len, optlen);
---
>         release_sock(sk);
>         if (len < 0)
>         {
>             return len;
>         }
>         return put_user(len, optlen);
```
This patch ensures that `put_user` is not called with a negative value of `len`, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the pointer `frame` may point to a location that is too close to the end of the `frame_end` boundary. When this happens, the buffer write to `frame` will overflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the pointer `frame` cannot point to a location that is too close to the end of the `frame_end` boundary. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to avoid `frame` pointing to a location that is too close to the end of the `frame_end` boundary. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<             if (frame_end - frame < width + 3)
---
>             if (frame_end - frame < width + 4)
```
This patch ensures that there is enough space left in the `frame` buffer to perform the write operation safely, thus preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
