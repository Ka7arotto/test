```
1 static s32 gf_media_vvc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
4 	s32 vps_id;
5 	VVC_VPS *vps;
9 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
10 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` may be less than 0. When this happens, the array access `vvc->vps[vps_id]` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `vps_id` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to avoid `vps_id` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```
This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the array `vvc->vps[vps_id]`, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 bit_write_UMC (Bit_Chain *dat, BITCODE_UMC val)
3   int i, j;
5   unsigned char byte[5];
6   BITCODE_UMC mask;
7   BITCODE_UMC value;
9   value = val;
10   mask = 0x0000007f;
11   for (i = 4, j = 0; i >= 0; i--, j += 7)
13       byte[i] = (unsigned char)((value & mask) >> j);
14       byte[i] |= 0x80;
15       mask = mask << 7;
17   for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
18     if (byte[i] & 0x7f)
21   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
22     i--;
23   byte[i] &= 0x7f;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
23   byte[i] &= 0x7f;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `i` may be less than 0 if the condition `byte[i] & 0x40` is true. When this happens, the array access `byte[i]` will underflow the boundary, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `i` cannot be less than 0. This can be done by adding a condition in the if statement to avoid `i` smaller than 0. Therefore the patch should be:
```
<   if (byte[i] & 0x40)
---
>   if (byte[i] & 0x40 && i > 0)
```
This patch ensures that the array access `byte[i]` will not underflow the boundary, thus fixing the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int crypto_report_acomp(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3     struct crypto_report_acomp racomp;
4     strlcpy(racomp.type, "acomp", sizeof(racomp.type));```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
4     strlcpy(racomp.type, "acomp", sizeof(racomp.type));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bound read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlcpy` function does not guarantee null termination when the destination buffer is not large enough. This can lead to an out-of-bound read when the string is later used.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use a function that guarantees null termination, such as `strncpy`. This function will pad the remaining buffer with null characters, ensuring that the string is properly terminated. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     strlcpy(racomp.type, "acomp", sizeof(racomp.type));
---
>     strncpy(racomp.type, "acomp", sizeof(racomp.type));
```


Q: Given the following code slice:

9 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
10 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.

```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the array `vvc->vps[vps_id]`, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int crypto_report_comp(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3 	struct crypto_report_comp rcomp;
5 	strlcpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
5 	strlcpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bound read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlcpy` function does not guarantee null-termination of the destination string when the source string is longer than the specified size. This can lead to an out-of-bound read vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to use a function that guarantees null-termination of the destination string. In this case, `strncpy` can be used instead of `strlcpy` to ensure that the destination string `rcomp.type` is null-terminated. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	strlcpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));
---
> 	strncpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 decrypt_response(struct sc_card *card, unsigned char *in, size_t inlen, unsigned char *out, size_t * out_len)
3 	size_t cipher_len;
4 	size_t i;
6 	unsigned char plaintext[4096] = { 0 };
9 	if (!card->drv_data) 
15 	if (in[0] == 0x99)
19 	if (0x01 == in[2] && 0x82 != in[1]) {
20 		cipher_len = in[1];
21 		i = 3;
23 	else if (0x01 == in[3] && 0x81 == in[1]) {
24 		cipher_len = in[2];
25 		i = 4;
27 	else if (0x01 == in[4] && 0x82 == in[1]) {
28 		cipher_len = in[2] * 0x100;
29 		cipher_len += in[3];
30 		i = 5;
36 	if (cipher_len < 2 || i+cipher_len > inlen || cipher_len > sizeof plaintext)
46 	while (0x80 != plaintext[cipher_len - 2] && (cipher_len - 2 > 0))
47 		cipher_len--;
49 	if (2 == cipher_len)
53 	*out_len = cipher_len - 2;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
53 	*out_len = cipher_len - 2;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the value of `cipher_len` is not checked before being used to calculate the value assigned to `*out_len`. If `cipher_len` is less than 2, the subtraction `cipher_len - 2` will result in an underflow, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to ensure that the value of `cipher_len` is valid before using it for calculation. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `cipher_len` is at least 2 before performing the subtraction. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (2 == cipher_len)
---
> 	if (2 == cipher_len || *out_len < cipher_len - 2)
```
This patch ensures that the subtraction `cipher_len - 2` will not result in an underflow, thus preventing the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 BOOL glyph_cache_put(rdpGlyphCache* glyphCache, UINT32 id, UINT32 index, rdpGlyph* glyph)
3 	rdpGlyph* prevGlyph;
5 	if (id > 9)
11 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `index` may be out of bounds of the array `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries`. This happens when `index` is greater than `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number`. When this happens, the read from `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index]` will be out-of-bounds, causing a CWE-125 vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the index `index` is within the bounds of the array `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries`. This can be done by changing the condition in the if statement to check if `index` is greater than or equal to `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number`. Therefore the patch should be:
```
< 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
---
> 	if (index >= glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
```
This patch ensures that the index `index` is within the bounds of the array, preventing the out-of-bounds read and CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int ext4_valid_extent(struct inode *inode, struct ext4_extent *ext)
3     ext4_fsblk_t block = ext4_ext_pblock(ext);
4     int len = ext4_ext_get_actual_len(ext);
5     return ext4_data_block_valid(EXT4_SB(inode->i_sb), block, len);```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
5     return ext4_data_block_valid(EXT4_SB(inode->i_sb), block, len);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read) vulnerability exists in the code because the function `ext4_data_block_valid` may read beyond the bounds of the buffer if `len` is zero. When this happens, the function may access memory outside the bounds of the buffer, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy. A common fixing strategy is to make sure that the function `ext4_data_block_valid` is not called with a zero `len` value. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `len` is zero before calling the function. If `len` is zero, the function should return a default value (in this case, 0) instead of calling `ext4_data_block_valid`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     int len = ext4_ext_get_actual_len(ext);
<     return ext4_data_block_valid(EXT4_SB(inode->i_sb), block, len);
---
>     int len = ext4_ext_get_actual_len(ext);
>     if (len == 0)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     return ext4_data_block_valid(EXT4_SB(inode->i_sb), block, len);
```

1 static int crypto_report_cipher(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3     struct crypto_report_cipher rcipher;
4     strlcpy(rcipher.type, "cipher", sizeof(rcipher.type));```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
4     strlcpy(rcipher.type, "cipher", sizeof(rcipher.type));
```
