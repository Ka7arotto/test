The CWE-476 vulnerability at line 28 is caused by a NULL pointer dereference. 

Here's the root cause analysis:

1. The `kasprintf` function is used to dynamically allocate memory for the `propname` string. This function returns a pointer to the allocated memory or NULL if the allocation fails.

2. The code checks if `propname` is NULL, but it does not handle the error properly. If `propname` is NULL, the function should return an error code or handle the error in some way. However, in this case, the function continues executing, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference later on.

3. The `propname` pointer is used in the `of_find_property` function call on line 30. If `propname` is NULL, this will cause a NULL pointer dereference, leading to undefined behavior.

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper error handling when `kasprintf` fails to allocate memory. To fix this vulnerability, the code should return an error code or handle the error in some way when `propname` is NULL.

Here's an example of how the code could be fixed:

```c
27 	propname = kasprintf(GFP_KERNEL, "pinctrl-%d", state);
28 	if (!propname) {
29 		ret = -ENOMEM; // or some other error code
30 		goto out; // or some other error handling mechanism
31 	}
```

This code checks if `propname` is NULL and returns an error code if it is. This prevents the NULL pointer dereference and fixes the CWE-476 vulnerability.
