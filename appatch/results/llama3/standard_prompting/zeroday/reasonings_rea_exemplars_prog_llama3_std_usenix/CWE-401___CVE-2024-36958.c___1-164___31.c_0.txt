The CWE-401 vulnerability is a "" vulnerability. However, in this specific code slice, the vulnerability is not immediately apparent. 

The root cause of the vulnerability is likely due to the fact that the `ignore_crossmnt` variable is being assigned a boolean value based on the result of the comparison `ignore_crossmnt != 0`. 

However, the issue arises because `ignore_crossmnt` is an integer, and it's being compared to 0. If `ignore_crossmnt` is a pointer that has been freed or is a dangling pointer, this comparison will not result in a segmentation fault or any other immediate error. 

Instead, the comparison will simply evaluate to a boolean value (0 or 1), which will then be assigned to `args.ignore_crossmnt`. This can lead to unexpected behavior later in the code, potentially causing a use-after-free vulnerability.

The correct fix would be to ensure that `ignore_crossmnt` is a valid integer value before performing the comparison. If `ignore_crossmnt` is supposed to be a pointer, it should be checked for NULL before being dereferenced.

Here's an example of how the code could be fixed:

```c
31 	if (ignore_crossmnt != NULL) {
32 		args.ignore_crossmnt = 1;
33 	} else {
34 		args.ignore_crossmnt = 0;
35 	}
```

Or, if `ignore_crossmnt` is supposed to be an integer:

```c
31 	if (ignore_crossmnt) {
32 		args.ignore_crossmnt = 1;
33 	} else {
34 		args.ignore_crossmnt = 0;
35 	}
```

However, without more context about the rest of the code and how `ignore_crossmnt` is being used, it's difficult to provide a more specific fix.
