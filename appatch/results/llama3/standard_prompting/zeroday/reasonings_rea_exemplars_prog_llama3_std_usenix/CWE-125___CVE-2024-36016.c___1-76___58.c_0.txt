The CWE-125 vulnerability at line 58 is caused by an **Incorrect Index Conventions** issue, but more specifically, it's a **Buffer Overwrite** vulnerability due to an **Insufficient Failsafe** mechanism.

The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `gsm->len` value is not properly validated before using it as an index to store data in the `gsm->buf` array. 

In lines 26 and 45, the code checks if `gsm->len` is greater than `gsm->mru` (Maximum Receive Unit), and if so, it resets `gsm->count` and does not proceed with storing data in the buffer. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a buffer overflow.

The issue arises because the `gsm->len` value is not validated against the actual buffer size before storing data in it. The `gsm->mru` value is likely a maximum allowed value for `gsm->len`, but it does not necessarily represent the actual buffer size.

In line 58, the code checks if `gsm->count` is equal to `gsm->len` before proceeding with the next state. However, if `gsm->len` is greater than the actual buffer size, this check will not prevent a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate `gsm->len` against the actual buffer size before storing data in it. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that `gsm->len` is less than or equal to the buffer size before proceeding with storing data.

Here's an example of how the fix could be implemented:
```c
if (gsm->len > sizeof(gsm->buf)) {
    // Handle error: buffer overflow
    // ...
} else {
    // Store data in buffer
    gsm->buf[gsm->count++] = c;
    if (gsm->count == gsm->len) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
Note that the actual fix will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the code, and may involve additional checks and error handling mechanisms.
