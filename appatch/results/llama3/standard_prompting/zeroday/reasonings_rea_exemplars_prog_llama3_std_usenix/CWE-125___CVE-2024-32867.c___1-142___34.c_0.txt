The CWE-125 vulnerability at line 34 is caused by an "Integer Overflow" issue. 

In this code, `len` is a `size_t` type variable, which is an unsigned integer type. The `frag->data_len` is also an integer type. When `frag->data_len` is added to `len`, it can cause an integer overflow if the sum of `len` and `frag->data_len` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `size_t` variable.

However, in this specific case, the issue is not the overflow itself, but rather the fact that the code does not check whether the `frag->data_len` is larger than the remaining space in the buffer. This can cause a buffer overflow when the data is written to the buffer.

The root cause of the vulnerability is that the code does not properly validate the `frag->data_len` before adding it to `len`. This can be exploited by an attacker who can control the `frag->data_len` value, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should check whether the `frag->data_len` is larger than the remaining space in the buffer before adding it to `len`. Additionally, the code should also check for integer overflow when adding `frag->data_len` to `len`.

Here is an example of how the code can be modified to fix the vulnerability:

```c
if (frag->data_len > (SIZE_MAX - len)) {
    // Handle the error, for example, by returning an error code
    return NULL;
}
len += frag->data_len;
```

This modification checks whether adding `frag->data_len` to `len` would cause an integer overflow, and if so, it handles the error. This prevents the buffer overflow vulnerability.
