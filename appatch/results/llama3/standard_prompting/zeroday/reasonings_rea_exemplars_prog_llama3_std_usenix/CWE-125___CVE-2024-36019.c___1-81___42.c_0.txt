The CWE-125 vulnerability is an "Out-of-bounds Read" vulnerability. 

The root cause of this vulnerability is that the code does not properly validate the index `max + 1` before using it to access the `entry` array. 

In the line `upper = kmemdup(&entry[max + 1],`, the code is attempting to copy data from the `entry` array starting from the index `max + 1`. However, if `max` is the last valid index in the `entry` array, then `max + 1` would be out of bounds.

This can lead to undefined behavior, including reading data from memory locations outside the bounds of the `entry` array, potentially causing a crash or allowing an attacker to read sensitive data.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should add a check to ensure that `max + 1` is within the valid bounds of the `entry` array before attempting to access it. 

For example:

```c
if (max + 1 < num_entries) {
    upper = kmemdup(&entry[max + 1], ...);
} else {
    // Handle the case where max + 1 is out of bounds
}
```

Where `num_entries` is the total number of elements in the `entry` array.
