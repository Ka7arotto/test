The CWE-125 vulnerability at line 187 is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `buf` array. This occurs when `len` is 0, and the code attempts to access `buf[len - 1]`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the root cause:

1.  The `len` variable is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the function (line 6).
2.  The `while` loop at line 187 is executed when `in_space` is true and `normalize` is true.
3.  If `len` is 0, the expression `buf[len - 1]` will access memory outside the bounds of the `buf` array, leading to undefined behavior.
4.  This can happen if the input data does not contain any characters that are copied to the `buf` array, or if all characters are removed due to normalization.

To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that `len` is greater than 0 before accessing `buf[len - 1]`. Here's an example of how you can modify the code:

```c
if ((in_space) && (normalize) && (len > 0)) {
    while (buf[len - 1] == 0x20) len--;
}
```

Alternatively, you can also consider using a more robust approach to handle the normalization of whitespace characters, such as using a separate function or algorithm that avoids accessing the `buf` array out of bounds.
