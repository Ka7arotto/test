The CWE-476 vulnerability refers to a null pointer dereference. Here are five possible code completions that fix this vulnerability:

**1. Null Check Before Dereference**
```c
if (pointer != NULL) {
    // Use the pointer here
    pointer->member = value;
}
```

**2. Initialize Pointer Before Use**
```c
pointer = malloc(sizeof(struct_type));
if (pointer != NULL) {
    // Use the pointer here
    pointer->member = value;
}
```

**3. Check for Null Before Function Call**
```c
if (pointer != NULL) {
    function_call(pointer);
}
```

**4. Use a Safe Pointer Dereference**
```c
if (pointer && pointer->member) {
    // Use the pointer here
    pointer->member->sub_member = value;
}
```

**5. Use a Smart Pointer (C++ only)**
```cpp
std::unique_ptr<struct_type> pointer(new struct_type());
if (pointer) {
    // Use the pointer here
    pointer->member = value;
}
```

In each of these examples, we're ensuring that the pointer is not null before attempting to dereference it, which fixes the CWE-476 vulnerability.
