```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_pps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc)
4 	s32 pps_id;
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
8 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
10 	if ((pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64)) {
14 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
16 	if (!pps->state) {
17 		pps->id = pps_id;
18 		pps->state = 1;
20 	pps->sps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "sps_id");
21 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
21 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the condition `if (pps->sps_id >= 16)` does not check for negative values of `pps->sps_id`. If `pps->sps_id` is a negative value, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps->sps_id` is not a negative value. The patch should add a condition to check for negative values of `pps->sps_id`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
---
> 	if ((pps->sps_id<0) || (pps->sps_id >= 16)) {
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static void ecall(mrb_state *mrb, int i)
3     struct RProc *p;
7     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
7     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because there is no check to ensure that the index `i` is within the bounds of the array `mrb->c->ensure`. If `i` is negative or greater than the size of the array, an out-of-bounds read will occur, leading to undefined behavior.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, a check should be added to ensure that the index `i` is within the bounds of the array before accessing it. If `i` is out of bounds, the function should return early to avoid the out-of-bounds read. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     struct RObject *exc;
<     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
---
>     struct RObject *exc;
>     if (i < 0)
>     {
>         return;
>     }
>     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_media_vvc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
4 	s32 vps_id;
5 	VVC_VPS *vps;
9 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
10 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` is used to access the `vps` array without proper bounds checking. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range before using it to access the `vps` array. The patch should add a condition to check if `vps_id` is less than 0 in addition to the existing check for `vps_id >= 16`. This will prevent the out-of-bounds read when `vps_id` is negative. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```
