```
1 R_API char *r_cons_hud_path(const char *path, int dir)
3     char *tmp = NULL, *ret = NULL;
4     RList *files;
5     while (*path == ' ')
7         path++;
9     if (!path || !*path)
11         tmp = strdup("./");
15         tmp = strdup(path);
17     files = r_sys_dir(tmp);
18     if (files)
20         ret = r_cons_hud(files, tmp);
21         if (ret)
23             tmp = r_str_concat(tmp, "/");
24             tmp = r_str_concat(tmp, ret);
25             ret = r_file_abspath(tmp);
26             free(tmp);
27             tmp = ret;
28             if (r_file_is_directory(tmp))
30                 ret = r_cons_hud_path(tmp, dir);
31                 free(tmp);
32                 tmp = ret;
38         eprintf("No files found\n");
40     if (!ret)
42         free(tmp);
43         return NULL;
45     return tmp;```
which has a CWE-457 vulnerability at line:
```
35     }
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the allocated memory for the `files` variable is not being freed before the function returns. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not being released properly.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the CWE-401 vulnerability, the allocated memory for the `files` variable needs to be freed before the function returns. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<         }
<     }
---
>         }
>         r_list_free(files);
>     }
```
