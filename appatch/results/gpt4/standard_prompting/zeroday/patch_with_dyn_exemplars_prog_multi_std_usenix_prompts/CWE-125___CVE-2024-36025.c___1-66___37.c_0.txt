```
1 BOOL glyph_cache_put(rdpGlyphCache* glyphCache, UINT32 id, UINT32 index, rdpGlyph* glyph)
3 	rdpGlyph* prevGlyph;
5 	if (id > 9)
11 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the comparison `index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number` allows `index` to be greater than the maximum valid index in `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `index` is within the bounds of valid indices for `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries`. This can be achieved by changing the comparison from `>` to `>=` to include the case where `index` is equal to the maximum valid index. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
---
> 	if (index >= glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static struct phy *serdes_simple_xlate(struct device *dev,
2 				       struct of_phandle_args *args)
4 	struct serdes_ctrl *ctrl = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
5 	unsigned int port, idx, i;
7 	if (args->args_count != 2)
11 	idx = args->args[1];
13 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
14 		struct serdes_macro *macro = phy_get_drvdata(ctrl->phys[i]);
16 		if (idx != macro->idx)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 		struct serdes_macro *macro = phy_get_drvdata(ctrl->phys[i]);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the loop condition `i <= SERDES_MAX` includes the value of `SERDES_MAX` itself, which may lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `ctrl->phys[i]` at index `SERDES_MAX`. This can result in reading memory beyond the allocated bounds, potentially causing a crash or other unexpected behavior.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, the loop condition should be changed to `i < SERDES_MAX` so that the loop iterates up to, but not including, the value of `SERDES_MAX`. This ensures that the index `i` stays within the bounds of the array `ctrl->phys[]`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
---
> 	for (i = 0; i < SERDES_MAX; i++) {
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int wm8994_get_retune_mobile_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `block` may be less than 0 if the function `wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block` returns a negative value. If `block` is negative, accessing `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block]` will result in an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the index `block` is not negative before accessing `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block]`. The patch adds a check to verify if `block` is less than 0, and if it is, the function returns early to prevent the out-of-bounds read. Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
<     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
---
>     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (block < 0)
>     {
>         return block;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static __u8 *sp_report_fixup(struct hid_device *hdev, __u8 *rdesc,
2 		unsigned int *rsize)
4 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
7 		rdesc[105] = rdesc[110] = 0x03;
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the code is trying to access `rdesc[111]` without ensuring that the array `rdesc` has at least 112 elements. This can lead to reading beyond the bounds of the array, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the array `rdesc` has at least 112 elements before accessing `rdesc[111]`. Therefore, the patch should increase the check on the size of `rdesc` to be greater than or equal to 112:
```
< 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
---
> 	if (*rsize >= 112 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` is used to access the `hevc->vps` array without proper bounds checking. If `vps_id` is negative or greater than or equal to 16, it will lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the `hevc->vps` array. The patch should add a condition to check if `vps_id` is negative as well, in addition to checking if it is greater than or equal to 16. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```


Q: Given the following code slice:

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` is used to access the `hevc->pps` array without proper bounds checking. If `pps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps_id` is within the valid range before using it to access the `hevc->pps` array. The patch should add a condition to check if `pps_id` is less than 0 in addition to the existing condition of `pps_id >= 64`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static __u8 *kye_report_fixup(struct hid_device *hdev, __u8 *rdesc,
2 		unsigned int *rsize)
4 	switch (hdev->product) {
13 		if (*rsize >= 74 &&
22 			rdesc[62] = 0x09;
23 			rdesc[64] = 0x04;
24 			rdesc[66] = 0x07;
25 			rdesc[72] = 0x01;
26 			rdesc[74] = 0x08;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
26 			rdesc[74] = 0x08;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `74` is being accessed in the array `rdesc`, which has a size of `*rsize`. Since arrays are zero-indexed, the valid indices for `rdesc` range from `0` to `*rsize - 1`. Accessing index `74` in an array of size less than `75` will result in an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the index `74` is within the bounds of the array `rdesc`. This can be done by changing the condition in the if statement to check if `*rsize` is greater than or equal to `75` instead of `74`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 		if (*rsize >= 74 &&
---
> 		if (*rsize >= 75 &&
```

11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` is used to access the `vps` array without proper bounds checking. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range before using it to access the `vps` array. The patch should add a condition to check if `vps_id` is less than 0 in addition to the existing check for `vps_id >= 16`. This will prevent the out-of-bounds read when `vps_id` is negative. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int drxj_dap_atomic_read_reg32(struct i2c_device_addr *dev_addr, u32 addr, u32 *data, u32 flags)
3     u8 buf[sizeof(*data)];
6     if (!data)
11     word = (u32)buf[3];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
11     word = (u32)buf[3];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the code is accessing the 4th element of the `buf` array (`buf[3]`) without checking the bounds of the array. This can lead to reading data outside the bounds of the array, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, a common strategy is to ensure that the array index is within the bounds of the array before accessing it. In this case, the patch adds a check for the return code `rc` from the `drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block` function. If the return code is less than 0, it means there was an error in reading or writing the block, so the function returns early to avoid accessing `buf` out of bounds. Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<     rc = drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block(dev_addr, addr, sizeof(*data), buf, true);
<     word = (u32)buf[3];
---
>     rc = drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block(dev_addr, addr, sizeof(*data), buf, true);
>     if (rc < 0)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     word = (u32)buf[3];
```
