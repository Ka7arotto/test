Q: Given the following code slice:
```
62 static int read_public_key(RSA *rsa)
64 	int r;
66 	sc_file_t *file;
67 	u8 buf[2048], *p = buf;
68 	size_t bufsize, keysize;
70 	r = select_app_df();
71 	if (r)
74 	r = sc_select_file(card, &path, &file);
75 	if (r) {
79 	bufsize = file->size;
81 	r = sc_read_binary(card, 0, buf, bufsize, 0);
1 int sc_read_binary(sc_card_t *card, unsigned int idx,
2 		   unsigned char *buf, size_t count, unsigned long *flags)
6 	int r;
8 	if (card == NULL || card->ops == NULL || buf == NULL) {
17 	if (card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary)   {
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `buf` array may not have enough space to store the data read from the `file`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the vulnerability lies in the potential for writing more data into `buf` than it can hold, which is a buffer overflow issue.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the `buf` array is not overflowed by limiting the amount of data read from the `file` to the size of the `buf` array. This can be achieved by using the `MIN` function to determine the minimum value between `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	bufsize = file->size;
---
> 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```
