Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 s32 vvc_parse_picture_header(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, VVCSliceInfo *si)
3 	u32 pps_id;
5 	si->irap_or_gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "irap_or_gdr_pic");
6 	si->non_ref_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "non_ref_pic");
7 	if (si->irap_or_gdr_pic)
8 		si->gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "gdr_pic");
9 	if ((si->inter_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "inter_slice_allowed_flag")))
10 		si->intra_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "intra_slice_allowed_flag");
12 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
13 	if (pps_id >= 64)
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` is used to access the `vvc->pps` array without proper bounds checking. If `pps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 64, it will result in an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps_id` is within the valid range before using it to access the `vvc->pps` array. Therefore, the patch should add a condition to check if `pps_id` is less than 0 in addition to the existing condition of `pps_id >= 64`. This will prevent the out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```
