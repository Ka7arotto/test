Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static __u8 *kye_report_fixup(struct hid_device *hdev, __u8 *rdesc,
2 		unsigned int *rsize)
4 	switch (hdev->product) {
13 		if (*rsize >= 74 &&
22 			rdesc[62] = 0x09;
23 			rdesc[64] = 0x04;
24 			rdesc[66] = 0x07;
25 			rdesc[72] = 0x01;
26 			rdesc[74] = 0x08;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
26 			rdesc[74] = 0x08;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `74` is being accessed in the array `rdesc`, which has a size of `*rsize`. Since arrays are zero-indexed, the valid indices for `rdesc` range from `0` to `*rsize - 1`. Accessing index `74` in an array of size less than `75` will result in an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the index `74` is within the bounds of the array `rdesc`. This can be done by changing the condition in the if statement to check if `*rsize` is greater than or equal to `75` instead of `74`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 		if (*rsize >= 74 &&
---
> 		if (*rsize >= 75 &&
```
