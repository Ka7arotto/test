5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
7 	s32 pps_id;

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` is used to access the `hevc->pps` array without proper bounds checking. If `pps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps_id` is within the valid range before using it to access the `hevc->pps` array. The patch should add a condition to check if `pps_id` is less than 0 in addition to the existing condition of `pps_id >= 64`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_media_vvc_read_pps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc)
4 	s32 pps_id;
5 	VVC_PPS *pps;

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
21 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the condition `if (pps->sps_id >= 16)` does not check for the lower boundary of `pps->sps_id`. If `pps->sps_id` is negative, the comparison `pps->sps_id >= 16` will still evaluate to true, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps->sps_id` is within a valid range. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `pps->sps_id` is less than 0 as well. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
---
> 	if ((pps->sps_id<0) || (pps->sps_id >= 16)) {
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int read_public_key(RSA *rsa)
3     int r;
5     sc_file_t *file;
7     size_t bufsize, keysize;
8     r = select_app_df();

14     r = sc_select_file(card, &path, &file);
15     if (r)
20     bufsize = file->size;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
20     bufsize = file->size;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `bufsize` variable is assigned the value of `file->size` without any boundary check. If `file->size` is larger than the size of the `bufsize` variable, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To prevent the out-of-bounds read vulnerability, a common fixing strategy is to ensure that the value assigned to `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the buffer. In this case, the patch is using the `MIN` macro to assign the minimum value between `file->size` and the size of the buffer `buf`. This ensures that `bufsize` will not exceed the buffer size, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     bufsize = file->size;
---
>     bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```

A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1.

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `drc` is used to access the `wm8994->drc_cfg` array without checking if `drc` is within the bounds of the array. If `drc` is a negative value or exceeds the bounds of the array, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, a common strategy is to add a check to ensure that the index `drc` is within the bounds of the array before accessing it. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
