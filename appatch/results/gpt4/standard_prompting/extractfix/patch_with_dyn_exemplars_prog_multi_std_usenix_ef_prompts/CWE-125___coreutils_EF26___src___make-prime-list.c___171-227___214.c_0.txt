```
1 static int wm8994_get_retune_mobile_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `block` may be less than 0 if the function `wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block` returns a negative value. If `block` is negative, accessing `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block]` will result in an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the index `block` is not negative before accessing `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block]`. The patch adds a check to verify if `block` is less than 0, and if it is, the function returns early to prevent the out-of-bounds read. Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
<     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
---
>     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (block < 0)
>     {
>         return block;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 BOOL glyph_cache_put(rdpGlyphCache* glyphCache, UINT32 id, UINT32 index, rdpGlyph* glyph)
3 	rdpGlyph* prevGlyph;
5 	if (id > 9)
11 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the comparison `index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number` allows `index` to be greater than the maximum valid index in `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `index` is within the bounds of valid indices for `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries`. This can be achieved by changing the comparison from `>` to `>=` to include the case where `index` is equal to the maximum valid index. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
---
> 	if (index >= glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int drxj_dap_atomic_read_reg32(struct i2c_device_addr *dev_addr, u32 addr, u32 *data, u32 flags)
3     u8 buf[sizeof(*data)];
6     if (!data)
11     word = (u32)buf[3];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
11     word = (u32)buf[3];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the code is accessing the 4th element of the `buf` array (`buf[3]`) without checking the bounds of the array. This can lead to reading data outside the bounds of the array, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, a common strategy is to ensure that the array index is within the bounds of the array before accessing it. In this case, the patch adds a check for the return code `rc` from the `drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block` function. If the return code is less than 0, it means there was an error in reading or writing the block, so the function returns early to avoid accessing `buf` out of bounds. Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<     rc = drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block(dev_addr, addr, sizeof(*data), buf, true);
<     word = (u32)buf[3];
---
>     rc = drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block(dev_addr, addr, sizeof(*data), buf, true);
>     if (rc < 0)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     word = (u32)buf[3];
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_media_vvc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
4 	s32 vps_id;
5 	VVC_VPS *vps;

10 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` is used to access the `vps` array without proper bounds checking. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range before using it to access the `vps` array. The patch should add a condition to check if `vps_id` is less than 0 in addition to the existing check for `vps_id >= 16`. This will prevent the out-of-bounds read when `vps_id` is negative. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```


Q: Given the following code slice:

A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` is used to access the `vps` array without checking if it is within bounds. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative before using it as an index to access the `vps` array. Therefore, the patch should add a condition to check if `vps_id` is less than 0 in addition to the existing condition that checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:
```

Q: Given the following code slice:

1 s32 hevc_parse_slice_segment(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, HEVCSliceInfo *si)
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
7 	s32 pps_id;

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` is used to access the `hevc->pps` array without proper bounds checking. If `pps_id` is negative, or greater than or equal to 64, it will lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps_id` is within the valid range before accessing the `hevc->pps` array. The patch should add a condition to check if `pps_id` is less than 0 in addition to the existing condition of `pps_id >= 64`. Therefore, the patch should be:

Q: Given the following code slice:

22     if (e == NULL || e->method == SC_AC_NEVER)
26     bufsize = file->size;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
26     bufsize = file->size;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `bufsize` variable is assigned the value of `file->size` without any boundary check. This can lead to a potential out-of-bounds read if `file->size` is larger than the size of the buffer `bufsize`. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to read sensitive information from memory beyond the allocated buffer.


Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, a common strategy is to ensure that the assignment to `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the buffer. One way to achieve this is by using the `MIN` macro to limit the value of `bufsize` to the minimum of `file->size` and the size of the buffer `buf`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     bufsize = file->size;
---
>     bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static void ecall(mrb_state *mrb, int i)

7     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
7     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because there is no check to ensure that the index `i` is within the bounds of the array `mrb->c->ensure`. If `i` is negative or greater than the size of the array, an out-of-bounds read will occur, leading to undefined behavior.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, a check should be added to ensure that the index `i` is within the bounds of the array before accessing it. If `i` is out of bounds, the function should return early to avoid the out-of-bounds read. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     struct RObject *exc;
<     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
---
>     struct RObject *exc;
>     if (i < 0)
>     {
>         return;
>     }
>     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` is used to access the `vvc->pps` array without proper bounds checking. If `pps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 64, it will result in an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to add a condition to check if `pps_id` is less than 0 in addition to the existing condition of checking if `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64. This will ensure that the index `pps_id` is within the bounds of the `vvc->pps` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
