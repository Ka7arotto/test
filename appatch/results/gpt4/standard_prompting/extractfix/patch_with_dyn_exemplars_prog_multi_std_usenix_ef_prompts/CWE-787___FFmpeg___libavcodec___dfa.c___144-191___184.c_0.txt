```
1 static int ProcRenderSetPictureFilter(ClientPtr client)
4     PicturePtr pPicture;
5     int result;
6     xFixed *params;
7     int nparams;
8     char *name;
11     name = (char *)(stuff + 1);
12     params = (xFixed *)(name + pad_to_int32(stuff->nbytes));
13     nparams = ((xFixed *)stuff + client->req_len) - params;
14     result = SetPictureFilter(pPicture, name, stuff->nbytes, params, nparams);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
14     result = SetPictureFilter(pPicture, name, stuff->nbytes, params, nparams);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the calculation of `nparams` at line 13 can result in a negative value if `params` is greater than `((xFixed *)stuff + client->req_len)`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when passing `nparams` to the `SetPictureFilter` function at line 14.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, a condition should be added to check if `nparams` is less than 0. If it is, then the function should return an error code (BadLength) to indicate that the length is invalid. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     nparams = ((xFixed *)stuff + client->req_len) - params;
<     result = SetPictureFilter(pPicture, name, stuff->nbytes, params, nparams);
---
>     nparams = ((xFixed *)stuff + client->req_len) - params;
>     if (nparams < 0)
>     {
>         return BadLength;
>     }
>     result = SetPictureFilter(pPicture, name, stuff->nbytes, params, nparams);
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int bnxt_get_nvram_item(struct net_device *dev, u32 index, u32 offset, u32 length, u8 *data)
3     struct bnxt *bp = netdev_priv(dev);
5     u8 *buf;
8     buf = dma_alloc_coherent(&bp->pdev->dev, length, &dma_handle, GFP_KERNEL);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
8     buf = dma_alloc_coherent(&bp->pdev->dev, length, &dma_handle, GFP_KERNEL);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `length` parameter is not checked for a valid value before using it to allocate memory for `buf`. If `length` is 0 or a negative value, it can lead to an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, a check should be added to ensure that the `length` parameter is a valid value before allocating memory for `buf`. If `length` is 0, the function should return an error code (such as -EINVAL) to indicate an invalid input. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     struct hwrm_nvm_read_input req = {0};
<     buf = dma_alloc_coherent(&bp->pdev->dev, length, &dma_handle, GFP_KERNEL);
---
>     struct hwrm_nvm_read_input req = {0};
>     if (!length)
>     {
>         return -EINVAL;
>     }
>     buf = dma_alloc_coherent(&bp->pdev->dev, length, &dma_handle, GFP_KERNEL);
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static void mousevsc_on_receive_device_info(struct mousevsc_dev *input_device, struct synthhid_device_info *device_info)
4     struct hid_descriptor *desc;
6     input_device->dev_info_status = 0;
7     memcpy(&input_device->hid_dev_info, &device_info->hid_dev_info, sizeof(hv_input_dev_info));
8     desc = &device_info->hid_descriptor;
10     input_device->hid_desc = kzalloc(desc->bLength, GFP_ATOMIC);
16     memcpy(input_device->hid_desc, desc, desc->bLength);
17     input_device->report_desc_size = desc->desc[0].wDescriptorLength;
18     input_device->report_desc = kzalloc(input_device->report_desc_size, GFP_ATOMIC);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
18     input_device->report_desc = kzalloc(input_device->report_desc_size, GFP_ATOMIC);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kzalloc` function is called with a size of `input_device->report_desc_size` without checking if the size is 0 or not. If `input_device->report_desc_size` is 0, it can lead to a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability when allocating memory for `input_device->report_desc`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, a condition should be added to check if `input_device->report_desc_size` is 0 before allocating memory for `input_device->report_desc`. If the size is 0, then the allocation should not be performed and appropriate cleanup or error handling should be done. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     input_device->report_desc_size = desc->desc[0].wDescriptorLength;
<     input_device->report_desc = kzalloc(input_device->report_desc_size, GFP_ATOMIC);
---
>     input_device->report_desc_size = desc->desc[0].wDescriptorLength;
>     if (input_device->report_desc_size == 0)
>     {
>         cleanup
>     }
>     input_device->report_desc = kzalloc(input_device->report_desc_size, GFP_ATOMIC);
```

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `buf` array may not have enough space to store the data read from the file. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `count` parameter passed to `sc_read_binary` is larger than the size of the `buf` array. This can result in writing data beyond the bounds of the `buf` array, causing a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability, the patch should ensure that the `buf` array is not overflowed by limiting the `bufsize` to the size of the `buf` array. This can be achieved by using the `MIN` macro to choose the minimum value between `file->size` and the size of the `buf` array. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	bufsize = file->size;
---
> 	bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```


Q: Given the following code slice:
```

3     struct _ostream *_stream = stream->real_stream;
4     if (stream->closed)

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
8     return _stream->send(_stream, data, size);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because there is no check for the size of the data being sent. If the size of the data is 0, there is a potential for an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when calling `_stream->send(_stream, data, size)`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To address this vulnerability, a check should be added to ensure that the size of the data being sent is not 0. If the size is 0, the function should return 0 without calling `_stream->send(_stream, data, size)`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
<     }
<     return _stream->send(_stream, data, size);
---
>     }
>     if (size == 0)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     return _stream->send(_stream, data, size);

A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1.

This can happen if the `file->size` is larger than the size of the `buf` array (2048 bytes).

```
53 	*out_len = cipher_len - 2;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
A: The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the assignment `*out_len = cipher_len - 2;` does not check if the value of `cipher_len - 2` is within the bounds of `out_len`. This can potentially lead to an out-of-bounds write if `cipher_len - 2` is greater than the value that `out_len` can hold.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the value being assigned to `*out_len` is within the bounds of `out_len`. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check if `*out_len` is less than `cipher_len - 2`. Therefore, the patch should be:
```
< 	if (2 == cipher_len)
---
> 	if (2 == cipher_len || *out_len < cipher_len - 2)
```

This patch ensures that the assignment to `*out_len` only occurs if the value being assigned (`cipher_len - 2`) is within the bounds of `out_len`, thus preventing a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
