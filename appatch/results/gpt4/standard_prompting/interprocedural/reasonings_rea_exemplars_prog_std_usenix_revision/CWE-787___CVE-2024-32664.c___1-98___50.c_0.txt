The CWE-787 vulnerability, also known as "Out-of-bounds Write," occurs when the software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to data corruption, a crash, or code execution vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet:
```c
1 static inline void DecodeBase64Block(uint8_t ascii[ASCII_BLOCK], uint8_t b64[B64_BLOCK])
3     ascii[0] = (uint8_t) (b64[0] << 2) | (b64[1] >> 4);
```
The vulnerability specifically mentioned at line 3 involves writing to the `ascii` array. The root cause of the vulnerability can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Assumptions about Buffer Sizes**: The function signature does not specify the sizes of the arrays `ascii` and `b64`. The macro names `ASCII_BLOCK` and `B64_BLOCK` suggest fixed sizes, but without knowing these sizes, it's unclear whether the buffers are adequately sized to handle the operations performed on them. If `ASCII_BLOCK` is less than 1, then writing to `ascii[0]` would be writing out of bounds.

2. **Lack of Boundary Checks**: The code does not perform any checks to ensure that the indices accessed on the `ascii` and `b64` arrays are within their respective bounds. This is particularly critical for `ascii[0]` where the function writes the result. If `ASCII_BLOCK` is defined as 0 (or any size less than 1), this line will attempt to write outside the allocated memory for `ascii`.

3. **Implicit Trust in Input Data**: The function assumes that the input data in `b64` is valid and correctly formatted as Base64 data. If `b64` contains fewer than 2 elements, accessing `b64[1]` could lead to undefined behavior, potentially reading from memory not allocated for `b64`. This could lead to incorrect data being used in the computation of `ascii[0]`.

4. **Type Casting and Bit Manipulation**: The expression `(uint8_t) (b64[0] << 2) | (b64[1] >> 4)` involves bit shifting and bitwise OR operations. While these are typical in decoding Base64, improper handling or unexpected values in `b64` could lead to unexpected results. However, the primary concern remains the potential out-of-bounds write.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the following steps should be considered:
- **Validate Input Sizes**: Ensure that the sizes of `ascii` and `b64` are checked against expected minimums before performing operations on them.
- **Boundary Checks**: Implement checks to ensure that no out-of-bounds accesses occur. For example, verify that `ASCII_BLOCK` is at least 1 since the code writes to `ascii[0]`.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Add error handling to manage cases where inputs do not meet expected criteria (e.g., too short, malformed data).

By addressing these issues, the function can be made safer and the risk of buffer overflow or out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities can be significantly reduced.
