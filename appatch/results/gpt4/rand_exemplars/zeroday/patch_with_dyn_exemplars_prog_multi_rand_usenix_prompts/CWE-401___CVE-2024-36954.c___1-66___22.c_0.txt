Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability in the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `create_setup_data_nodes` is responsible for creating setup data nodes and adding them to a debug filesystem directory.
   - It allocates memory for `node` using `kmalloc` and assigns it to `node`.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The memory allocated to `node` using `kmalloc` at line 18 needs to be properly managed to avoid memory leaks.
   - If the condition `if (!data)` at line 28 is true, the function sets `error` to `-ENXIO` and jumps to the `err_dir` label at line 31.
   - However, before jumping to `err_dir`, the allocated memory for `node` is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

3. **Memory Management:**
   - Proper memory management requires that any allocated memory should be freed if it is no longer needed or if an error occurs before the memory is used.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Freeing Allocated Memory:**
   - To fix the memory leak, we need to ensure that the allocated memory for `node` is freed if the function encounters an error and jumps to the `err_dir` label.
   - This can be done by adding a call to `kfree(node)` before setting the `error` and jumping to the `err_dir` label.

2. **Applying the Patch:**
   - The patch should add `kfree(node);` before setting `error` to `-ENXIO` and jumping to `err_dir`.

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that the allocated memory for `node` is properly freed in case of an error, thus preventing a memory leak. Here is the patched code with the added `kfree(node);`:

```diff
<             {
<                 error = -ENXIO;
---
>             {
>                 kfree(node);
>                 error = -ENXIO;
```

### Final Patched Code Slice

```c

2 {
3     struct setup_data_node *node;
4     struct setup_data *data;
5     int error, no = 0;
6     struct dentry *d;

35         else
36         {

39         node->paddr = pa_data;
40         node->type = data->type;
41         node->len = data->len;
42         error = create_setup_data_node(d, no, node);
43         pa_data = data->next;
44         if (PageHighMem(pg))
45         {
46             iounmap(data);
47         }
48         if (error)
49         {

54     return 0;
55     err_dir debugfs_remove(d);
56     err_return return error;

By following these steps, we ensure that the memory allocated for `node` is properly managed, thus preventing a memory leak and addressing the CWE-401 vulnerability.

which has a CWE-401 vulnerability at line:

16         }
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability in the given code slice, we need to follow a systematic approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `ff_rtsp_close_streams` is responsible for closing and cleaning up RTSP streams associated with an `AVFormatContext` object.
   - The function iterates over the `rtsp_streams` array, performs some cleanup operations, and then frees various resources.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The loop at lines 7-17 iterates over the `rtsp_streams` array and performs cleanup operations for each stream.
   - The `if` conditions at lines 10 and 12 check if the `rtsp_st` pointer and its `dynamic_handler` and `dynamic_protocol_context` members are valid before calling the `close` method.
   - However, after performing the cleanup operations, the memory allocated for each `RTSPStream` object (`rtsp_st`) is not freed.

3. **Memory Leak Identification:**
   - The `RTSPStream` objects are dynamically allocated, and their pointers are stored in the `rt->rtsp_streams` array.
   - Failing to free these objects results in a memory leak, as the allocated memory is not reclaimed even after the streams are closed.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Freeing the Allocated Memory:**
   - To fix the memory leak, we need to ensure that the memory allocated for each `RTSPStream` object is freed after it is no longer needed.
   - This can be done by calling `av_free(rtsp_st)` after the cleanup operations within the loop.

2. **Applying the Patch:**
   - The patch should add a call to `av_free(rtsp_st)` after the `if` block that performs the cleanup operations.
   - This ensures that each `RTSPStream` object is properly freed, preventing the memory leak.

### Conclusion

The patch should be applied as follows:

```diff
<             }
<         }
---
>             }
>             av_free(rtsp_st);
>         }
```

### Final Code with Patch Applied

```c
1 void ff_rtsp_close_streams(AVFormatContext *s)
2 {
3     RTSPState *rt = s->priv_data;
4     int i;
5     RTSPStream *rtsp_st;
6     ff_rtsp_undo_setup(s);
7     for (i = 0; i < rt->nb_rtsp_streams; i++)
8     {
9         rtsp_st = rt->rtsp_streams[i];
10         if (rtsp_st)
11         {
12             if (rtsp_st->dynamic_handler && rtsp_st->dynamic_protocol_context)
13             {
14                 rtsp_st->dynamic_handler->close(rtsp_st->dynamic_protocol_context);
15             }
16             av_free(rtsp_st);
17         }
18     }
19     av_free(rt->rtsp_streams);
20     if (rt->asf_ctx)
21     {
22         av_close_input_stream(rt->asf_ctx);
23         rt->asf_ctx = NULL;
24     }
25     av_free(rt->p);
26     av_free(rt->recvbuf);
27 }
```

By adding the `av_free(rtsp_st);` call within the loop, we ensure that each `RTSPStream` object is properly freed, thus preventing the memory leak and addressing the CWE-401 vulnerability.

28         kfree(output);```
which has a CWE-401 vulnerability at line:
```
23         return;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability in the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach. Here are the reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Identify the Vulnerability:**
   - CWE-401 refers to a memory leak, which occurs when memory is allocated but not properly deallocated, leading to wasted memory resources.

2. **Examine Memory Allocation:**
   - At line 14, memory is allocated to `output` using `uml_kmalloc`:
     ```c
     output = uml_kmalloc(output_len, UM_GFP_KERNEL);
     ```
   - This allocation needs to be properly freed to avoid a memory leak.

3. **Check for Early Returns:**
   - The function has an early return at line 23:
     ```c
     return;
     ```
   - If the function returns early, the allocated memory for `output` will not be freed, leading to a memory leak.

4. **Determine Conditions for Early Return:**
   - The early return occurs if `pid < 0`:
     ```c
     if (pid < 0)
     {
         return;
     }
     ```
   - Before this check, `output` is allocated and not yet freed.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Ensure Proper Deallocation:**
   - To fix the memory leak, we need to ensure that `output` is freed before any early return that bypasses the normal deallocation path.

2. **Modify the Code:**
   - Add a call to `kfree(output)` before the early return at line 23 to ensure the allocated memory is properly deallocated.

### Step 3: Implement the Patch

1. **Original Code:**
   ```c
   if (pid < 0)
   {
       return;
   }
   ```

2. **Patched Code:**
   ```c
   if (pid < 0)
   {
       kfree(output);
       return;
   }
   ```

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that the allocated memory for `output` is freed before the function returns early, thus preventing the memory leak. Here is the complete reasoning for the patch:

- **Root Cause Analysis:**
  - The memory allocated to `output` is not freed if the function returns early due to `pid < 0`.

- **Fixing Strategy:**
  - Add a call to `kfree(output)` before the early return to ensure proper deallocation of memory.

- **Patch Implementation:**
  ```c
  <     {
  <         return;
  ---
  >     {
  >         kfree(output);
  >         return;
  ```

By following these steps, we ensure that the memory leak is fixed, and the function properly deallocates memory in all execution paths.

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability in the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `r_cons_hud_path` takes a `path` and an integer `dir` as arguments.
   - It processes the `path` to remove leading spaces and then duplicates the `path` string.
   - It calls `r_sys_dir(tmp)` to get a list of files in the directory specified by `tmp`.
   - If files are found, it processes them further and constructs a new path.
   - If no files are found, it prints an error message.

2. **Identifying Memory Allocations:**
   - `tmp` is allocated memory using `strdup` at lines 11 and 15.
   - `files` is allocated memory by the `r_sys_dir(tmp)` function at line 17.
   - `ret` is allocated memory by the `r_cons_hud(files, tmp)` function at line 20.
   - Additional memory allocations occur in `r_str_concat` and `r_file_abspath`.

3. **Memory Deallocation:**
   - `tmp` is freed at lines 26, 31, and 42.
   - `ret` is reassigned and freed appropriately.
   - However, `files` is not freed if it is allocated by `r_sys_dir`.

4. **Potential Memory Leak:**
   - The `files` list is allocated memory but is not freed if the function exits without freeing it.
   - Specifically, if the function returns early or completes without freeing `files`, it results in a memory leak.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

To fix the memory leak, we need to ensure that `files` is freed before the function exits. This can be done by adding a call to `r_list_free(files)` before any return statement or at the end of the function where `files` is no longer needed.

### Step 3: Applying the Patch

1. **Locate the End of the Block Where `files` is Used:**
   - The block where `files` is used ends at line 35.

2. **Add the Freeing Statement:**
   - Add `r_list_free(files);` after the block to ensure `files` is freed.

3. **Patch the Code:**
   - The patch should be applied as follows:

```diff
<         }
<     }
---
>         }
>         r_list_free(files);
>     }
```

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that the `files` list is freed after it is no longer needed, preventing a memory leak. This is a common practice to manage dynamically allocated memory and avoid resource leaks in C programs. The reasoning steps involve understanding the code context, identifying memory allocations and deallocations, and ensuring all allocated memory is properly freed before the function exits.

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability in the given code slice, we need to follow a systematic approach to identify the root cause and then apply the appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `nvm_ioctl_get_devices` is responsible for gathering device information and copying it to user space.
   - Memory is allocated for `devices` using `kzalloc` at line 10.
   - The function checks for necessary permissions and memory allocation success.
   - It then locks a resource with `down_write(&nvm_lock)` and iterates over a list of devices, populating the `devices` structure.
   - After the loop, it unlocks the resource with `up_write(&nvm_lock)` and attempts to copy the populated `devices` structure to user space using `copy_to_user`.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The potential vulnerability lies in the error handling after the `copy_to_user` call at line 40.
   - If `copy_to_user` fails, it returns a non-zero value, indicating an error.
   - The current code immediately returns `-EFAULT` without freeing the allocated memory for `devices`.

3. **Memory Leak Scenario:**
   - If `copy_to_user` fails, the allocated memory for `devices` is not freed, leading to a memory leak.
   - This is a classic example of CWE-401: Memory Leak, where dynamically allocated memory is not properly deallocated in all code paths.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Ensuring Proper Memory Deallocation:**
   - To fix the memory leak, we need to ensure that the allocated memory for `devices` is freed in all code paths, including the error path.
   - Specifically, if `copy_to_user` fails, we should free the `devices` memory before returning the error code.

2. **Applying the Patch:**
   - Modify the error handling code after the `copy_to_user` call to include a call to `kfree(devices)` before returning `-EFAULT`.

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that the allocated memory for `devices` is properly freed in the error path, preventing the memory leak. The modified code snippet is as follows:

```diff
<     {
<         return -EFAULT;
---
>     {
>         kfree(devices);
>         return -EFAULT;
```

### Final Patched Code

Here is the final patched code with the memory leak fixed:

```c
1 static long nvm_ioctl_get_devices(struct file *file, void __user *arg)
2 {
3     struct nvm_ioctl_get_devices *devices;

10     devices = kzalloc(sizeof(nvm_ioctl_get_devices), GFP_KERNEL);
11     if (!devices)
12     {
13         return -ENOMEM;
14     }
15     down_write(&nvm_lock);
16     list_for_each_entry(, , )
17     {
18         struct nvm_ioctl_device_info *info = &devices->info[i];
19         sprintf(info->devname, "%s", dev->name);
20         if (dev->mt)
21         {
22             info->bmversion[0] = dev->mt->version[0];
23             info->bmversion[1] = dev->mt->version[1];
24             info->bmversion[2] = dev->mt->version[2];
25             sprintf(info->bmname, "%s", dev->mt->name);
26         }
27         else
28         {
29             sprintf(info->bmname, "none");
30         }
31         i++;
32         if (i > 31)
33         {
34             pr_err("nvm: max 31 devices can be reported.\n");
35             break;
36         }
37     }
38     up_write(&nvm_lock);
39     devices->nr_devices = i;
40     if (copy_to_user(arg, devices, sizeof(nvm_ioctl_get_devices)))
41     {
42         kfree(devices);  // Free the allocated memory in the error path
43         return -EFAULT;
44     }
45     kfree(devices);
46     return 0;
47 }
```

This patch ensures that the memory allocated for `devices` is always freed, preventing the memory leak vulnerability.

which has a CWE-401 vulnerability at line:
```
76     pool->nonce1 = strdup(json_string_value(json_array_get(res_val, 1)));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

#### Understanding the Code:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `initiate_stratum` is responsible for initiating a connection to a pool server, sending a subscription request, and processing the response.
2. **Memory Allocation**: The function allocates memory dynamically using `strdup` to store strings received from the server.
3. **Potential Memory Leak**: The line `pool->nonce1 = strdup(json_string_value(json_array_get(res_val, 1)));` allocates memory for `pool->nonce1` without checking if `pool->nonce1` already points to previously allocated memory.

#### Identifying the Vulnerability:
- **CWE-401: Memory Leak**: If `pool->nonce1` already contains a pointer to previously allocated memory, calling `strdup` again without freeing the old memory will result in a memory leak. This is because the old memory will no longer be accessible, and thus cannot be freed.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

#### Strategy:
- **Free Previously Allocated Memory**: Before assigning a new value to `pool->nonce1`, ensure that any previously allocated memory is freed. This prevents memory leaks by ensuring that the old memory is properly deallocated before the new memory is assigned.

#### Implementation:
- **Add a `free` Call**: Insert a call to `free(pool->nonce1)` before reassigning `pool->nonce1` with the result of `strdup`.

### Conclusion:
The patch ensures that any previously allocated memory for `pool->nonce1` is freed before assigning new memory to it. This prevents memory leaks by ensuring that the old memory is properly deallocated.

### Patch:
```diff
<     }
<     pool->nonce1 = strdup(json_string_value(json_array_get(res_val, 1)));
---
>     }
>     free(pool->nonce1);
>     pool->nonce1 = strdup(json_string_value(json_array_get(res_val, 1)));
```

### Detailed Reasoning Steps:
1. **Identify the Vulnerable Line**: The line `pool->nonce1 = strdup(json_string_value(json_array_get(res_val, 1)));` is identified as the source of the memory leak.
2. **Understand the Allocation**: `strdup` allocates memory for a copy of the string returned by `json_string_value`.
3. **Check for Existing Allocation**: Before assigning the new value, check if `pool->nonce1` already points to allocated memory.
4. **Free Existing Memory**: If `pool->nonce1` is not `NULL`, free the existing memory to prevent a memory leak.
5. **Assign New Value**: After freeing the old memory, assign the new value to `pool->nonce1`.

By following these steps, the patch ensures that memory is managed correctly, preventing memory leaks and adhering to best practices for dynamic memory management.

which has a CWE-401 vulnerability at line:
```
62             }
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context**:
   - The function `do_dev_config` is responsible for configuring a device by iterating over a set of options and performing various operations, including memory allocations.
   - The structure `devpriv` holds device-specific information, including a dynamically allocated array `devs` of `bonded_device` structures.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability**:
   - The vulnerability is a memory leak (CWE-401) that occurs when the function fails to free allocated memory before returning an error.
   - Specifically, the memory allocated for `bdev` using `kmalloc` at line 47 is not freed if the subsequent `krealloc` call at line 57 fails.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - At line 47, memory is allocated for `bdev` using `kmalloc`.
   - If `krealloc` fails at line 57, the function returns an error at line 62 without freeing the previously allocated `bdev`.
   - This results in a memory leak because the allocated memory for `bdev` is not released.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Ensuring Proper Memory Management**:
   - To fix the memory leak, we need to ensure that any allocated memory is properly freed before returning an error.
   - Specifically, if `krealloc` fails, we should free the memory allocated for `bdev` before returning.

2. **Implementing the Fix**:
   - Modify the error handling code to include a call to `kfree(bdev)` before returning the error code.

### Conclusion:
The patch ensures that the memory allocated for `bdev` is freed if `krealloc` fails, thus preventing the memory leak.

### Patch Implementation:
```diff
<                 dev_err(dev->class_dev, "Could not allocate memory. Out of memory?\n");
<                 return -ENOMEM;
---
>                 dev_err(dev->class_dev, "Could not allocate memory. Out of memory?\n");
>                 kfree(bdev);
>                 return -ENOMEM;
```

### Reasoning Steps for Generating the Patch:

1. **Identify the Memory Allocation**:
   - `bdev` is allocated using `kmalloc` at line 47.

2. **Locate the Error Handling Code**:
   - The error handling code for `krealloc` failure is at line 62.

3. **Add Memory Deallocation**:
   - Before returning the error code, add a call to `kfree(bdev)` to free the allocated memory.

4. **Verify the Fix**:
   - Ensure that the memory allocated for `bdev` is properly freed in all error paths to prevent memory leaks.

By following these steps, the patch effectively addresses the CWE-401 vulnerability by ensuring proper memory management and preventing memory leaks.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```

15         clear->TempBuffer = (BYTE *)malloc(clear->TempSize);
16         clear_context_reset(clear);
18     return clear;```
which has a CWE-401 vulnerability at line:
```
12         }
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Memory Allocation:**
   - At line 4, memory is allocated for `clear` using `calloc`.
   - `calloc` initializes the allocated memory to zero and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.

2. **Conditional Check:**
   - At line 5, there is a check to see if the memory allocation was successful (`if (clear)`).

3. **Nested Memory Allocation:**
   - At line 8, another memory allocation is performed by calling `nsc_context_new()`, which presumably allocates memory for `clear->nsc`.

4. **Failure Handling:**
   - At line 9, there is a check to see if the allocation for `clear->nsc` was successful (`if (!clear->nsc)`).
   - If the allocation fails, the function returns `NULL` at line 11.

### Identifying the Vulnerability

- **Memory Leak:**
  - If the allocation for `clear->nsc` fails, the function returns `NULL` without freeing the previously allocated memory for `clear`.
  - This results in a memory leak because the memory allocated at line 4 is not freed before returning.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

To fix the memory leak, we need to ensure that any allocated memory is properly freed before returning from the function in case of an error. Specifically, if the allocation for `clear->nsc` fails, we should free the memory allocated for `clear` before returning `NULL`.

### Applying the Fix

The fix involves adding a call to `free(clear)` before returning `NULL` at line 11. Here is the modified code with the patch applied:

```diff
<         {
<             return NULL;
---
>         {
>             free(clear);
>             return NULL;
```

### Conclusion

By adding the `free(clear);` statement before returning `NULL`, we ensure that the memory allocated for `clear` is properly freed in case of an error, thus preventing a memory leak. This addresses the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability in the code.

### Final Patched Code

Here is the final patched version of the code:

```c
1 CLEAR_CONTEXT *clear_context_new(BOOL Compressor)
2 {
3     CLEAR_CONTEXT *clear;
4     clear = (CLEAR_CONTEXT *)calloc(1, sizeof(CLEAR_CONTEXT));
5     if (clear)
6     {
7         clear->Compressor = Compressor;
8         clear->nsc = nsc_context_new();
9         if (!clear->nsc)
10         {
11             free(clear);
12             return NULL;
13         }
14         nsc_context_set_pixel_format(clear->nsc, RDP_PIXEL_FORMAT_R8G8B8);
15         clear->TempSize = 512 * 512 * 4;
16         clear->TempBuffer = (BYTE *)malloc(clear->TempSize);
17         clear_context_reset(clear);
18     }
19     return clear;
20 }
```

This ensures that the memory allocated for `clear` is properly freed if the allocation for `clear->nsc` fails, thus preventing a memory leak.

which has a CWE-401 vulnerability at line:
```
26         }
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To address the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability in the given code slice, we need to follow a systematic approach to identify the root cause and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `cancel_channel_subscription` is designed to cancel subscriptions to a channel.
   - It iterates through a linked list of subscriptions (`chan->subscriptions`), checking if each subscription matches the given `sd` (socket descriptor).
   - If a match is found, the subscription is cancelled, and the corresponding list node is freed.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The code frees the `list` node when a matching subscription is found (`free(list);` at line 16).
   - However, the `list` node contains a pointer to a `subscription` object (`subscr`), which is not freed.
   - This results in a memory leak because the memory allocated for the `subscription` object is not released.

3. **Memory Management:**
   - Proper memory management requires that all dynamically allocated memory is freed when it is no longer needed.
   - In this case, both the `list` node and the `subscription` object it points to must be freed to avoid memory leaks.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Freeing the `subscription` Object:**
   - To fix the memory leak, we need to ensure that the `subscription` object is also freed when a matching subscription is cancelled.
   - This can be done by adding a call to `free(subscr);` after `free(list);`.

2. **Applying the Patch:**
   - The patch involves adding the line `free(subscr);` immediately after `free(list);` to ensure both the list node and the subscription object are freed.

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that both the `list` node and the `subscription` object are properly freed, thus preventing the memory leak. Here is the patched code with the added line:

```diff
<             free(list);
<             if (prev)
---
>             free(list);
>             free(subscr);
>             if (prev)
```

### Final Patched Code

```c
1 static int cancel_channel_subscription(struct nerd_channel *chan, int sd)
2 {
3     objectlist *list, *next, *prev = NULL;
4     int cancelled = 0;
5     if (!chan)
6     {
7         return -1;
8     }
9     for (list = chan->subscriptions; list; list = next)
10     {
11         struct subscription *subscr = (subscription *)list->object_ptr;
12         next = list->next;
13         if (subscr->sd == sd)
14         {
15             cancelled++;
16             free(list);
17             free(subscr); // Added line to free the subscription object
18             if (prev)
19             {
20                 prev->next = next;
21             }
22             else
23             {
24                 chan->subscriptions = next;
25             }
26             continue;
27         }
28         prev = list;
29     }
30     if (cancelled)
31     {
32         logit(NSLOG_INFO_MESSAGE, TRUE, "nerd: Cancelled %d subscription%s to channel '%s' for %d\n", cancelled, cancelled == 1 ? "" : "s", chan->name, sd);
33     }
34     if (chan->subscriptions == NULL)
35     {
36         nerd_deregister_channel_callbacks(chan);
37     }
38     return 0;
39 }
```

By following these reasoning steps, we ensure that the memory leak is properly addressed, and the code is more robust and secure.
