```
1 GPMF_ERR IsValidSize(GPMF_stream *ms, uint32_t size) // size is in longs not bytes.
3 	if (ms)
5 		int32_t nestsize = (int32_t)ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level];```
which has a CWE-190 vulnerability at line:
```
5 		int32_t nestsize = (int32_t)ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `IsValidSize` takes a pointer to a `GPMF_stream` structure and a size parameter.
   - The comment indicates that the `size` parameter is in "longs" (presumably 32-bit units) rather than bytes.
   - The code checks if the `ms` pointer is not null.
   - It then retrieves a value from the `nest_size` array at the index `nest_level` and casts it to `int32_t`.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The line in question is:
     ```c
     int32_t nestsize = (int32_t)ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level];
     ```
   - The potential vulnerability here is a CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound.
   - The `nest_size` array likely holds unsigned 32-bit values (`uint32_t`), but the code casts the value to a signed 32-bit integer (`int32_t`).
   - If the value in `ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level]` is greater than `INT32_MAX` (the maximum value for a signed 32-bit integer), the cast will result in an incorrect negative value due to integer overflow.

3. **Consequences of the Vulnerability:**
   - An incorrect negative value for `nestsize` can lead to undefined behavior in subsequent code that uses this variable.
   - This can cause logic errors, crashes, or even security vulnerabilities if the value is used in memory allocation, array indexing, or other critical operations.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Correct Data Type Usage:**
   - To prevent the integer overflow, we should use the correct data type that matches the original type of the `nest_size` array elements.
   - Since `ms->nest_size` is likely an array of `uint32_t`, we should use `uint32_t` for the `nestsize` variable as well.

2. **Applying the Patch:**
   - Change the type of `nestsize` from `int32_t` to `uint32_t` to match the type of the values stored in `ms->nest_size`.
   - This ensures that the value is correctly interpreted as an unsigned 32-bit integer, preventing overflow issues.

### Conclusion

The patch should change the type of `nestsize` to `uint32_t` to prevent integer overflow. The corrected code is:

```c
< 		int32_t nestsize = (int32_t)ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level];
---
> 		uint32_t nestsize = (uint32_t)ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level];
```

By making this change, we ensure that the value retrieved from `ms->nest_size` is correctly handled as an unsigned 32-bit integer, thus preventing potential overflow and ensuring the integrity of the program's logic.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 GPMF_ERR IsValidSize(GPMF_stream *ms, uint32_t size) // size is in longs not bytes.

5 		int32_t nestsize = (int32_t)ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level];```
which has a CWE-190 vulnerability at line:
```
5 		int32_t nestsize = (int32_t)ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `IsValidSize` takes a `GPMF_stream` pointer `ms` and a `size` parameter.
   - The comment indicates that `size` is in longs, not bytes.
   - The code checks if `ms` is not null.
   - The line in question retrieves a value from the `nest_size` array at the index `ms->nest_level` and casts it to `int32_t`.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The potential vulnerability here is a CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound.
   - The `nest_size` array likely holds unsigned values (e.g., `uint32_t`), but the code casts the value to a signed integer (`int32_t`).
   - If the value in `ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level]` is larger than `INT32_MAX` (the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer), casting it to `int32_t` will cause an overflow, resulting in an incorrect and potentially negative value.

3. **Potential Impact:**
   - An overflow can lead to incorrect program behavior, including logic errors, memory corruption, or security vulnerabilities.
   - Specifically, using a negative or incorrect `nestsize` could lead to further issues in subsequent code that relies on this value.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Correct Data Type Usage:**
   - To prevent the overflow, we should use the correct data type that matches the original type of the `nest_size` array elements.
   - If `ms->nest_size` is an array of `uint32_t`, we should not cast its elements to `int32_t`.

2. **Applying the Fix:**
   - Change the type of `nestsize` from `int32_t` to `uint32_t` to match the type of the elements in `ms->nest_size`.
   - This ensures that the value is correctly interpreted as an unsigned integer, preventing overflow issues.

### Conclusion

The root cause of the vulnerability is the incorrect casting of an unsigned integer to a signed integer, which can lead to overflow. The fix involves using the correct unsigned integer type to prevent this issue.

### Patch

The patch changes the type of `nestsize` from `int32_t` to `uint32_t`:

```diff
< 		int32_t nestsize = (int32_t)ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level];
---
> 		uint32_t nestsize = (uint32_t)ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level];
```

This ensures that the value from `ms->nest_size[ms->nest_level]` is correctly handled as an unsigned integer, preventing overflow and ensuring the correct behavior of the program.

3     char type[4];

9     size = GetPSDSize(psd_info, image);
10     if (size == 0)

which has a CWE-190 vulnerability at line:
```
175                 length = (MagickSizeType)ReadBlobByte(image);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability at line 175, we need to follow a structured approach to understand the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The function `ReadPSDLayers` reads and processes layers from a PSD (Photoshop Document) file.
   - The variable `length` is assigned a value from the function `ReadBlobByte(image)`.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - `ReadBlobByte(image)` reads a byte from the image blob and returns it. The return type is likely an `int` or `unsigned char`.
   - The value read is cast to `MagickSizeType`, which is a type used to represent sizes and is typically a large unsigned integer type.

3. **Potential Overflow:**
   - If `ReadBlobByte(image)` returns a value that, when cast to `MagickSizeType`, could cause an overflow or wraparound, it can lead to incorrect size calculations.
   - Specifically, if `ReadBlobByte(image)` returns a negative value (if it returns an `int`), casting it directly to `MagickSizeType` could result in a very large positive value due to the way integer promotion and casting work in C/C++.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Ensuring Correct Casting:**
   - To prevent the overflow, we need to ensure that the value read from `ReadBlobByte(image)` is correctly interpreted as an unsigned byte.
   - By casting the result of `ReadBlobByte(image)` to `unsigned char` first, we ensure that any negative values are correctly handled as positive values within the range of 0 to 255.

2. **Applying the Patch:**
   - The patch involves changing the cast to ensure the value is treated as an `unsigned char` before being cast to `MagickSizeType`.

### Conclusion:
The patch ensures that the value read from `ReadBlobByte(image)` is correctly interpreted as an unsigned byte, preventing potential overflow or wraparound issues when it is cast to `MagickSizeType`.

### Patch:
```diff
<                 length = (MagickSizeType)ReadBlobByte(image);
---
>                 length = (MagickSizeType)(unsigned char)ReadBlobByte(image);
```

### Detailed Reasoning for the Patch:
- **Original Line:**
  ```c
  length = (MagickSizeType)ReadBlobByte(image);
  ```
  - This line directly casts the result of `ReadBlobByte(image)` to `MagickSizeType`.
  - If `ReadBlobByte(image)` returns a negative value, this could lead to an incorrect large positive value in `length`.

- **Patched Line:**
  ```c
  length = (MagickSizeType)(unsigned char)ReadBlobByte(image);
  ```
  - This line first casts the result of `ReadBlobByte(image)` to `unsigned char`, ensuring the value is within the range 0 to 255.
  - Then, it casts the `unsigned char` value to `MagickSizeType`, preventing any potential overflow or wraparound issues.

By following these reasoning steps, we ensure that the patch effectively addresses the CWE-190 vulnerability by correctly handling the value read from the image blob.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 xfs_acl_from_disk(struct xfs_acl *aclp)
4 	struct posix_acl *acl;
6 	int count, i;
8 	count = be32_to_cpu(aclp->acl_cnt);
9 	if (count > XFS_ACL_MAX_ENTRIES)
12 	acl = posix_acl_alloc(count, GFP_KERNEL);```
which has a CWE-190 vulnerability at line:
```
12 	acl = posix_acl_alloc(count, GFP_KERNEL);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching process for addressing the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability in the given code slice can be broken down into two main steps: Root Cause Analysis and Fixing Strategy.

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `xfs_acl_from_disk` is responsible for converting an on-disk ACL (Access Control List) structure to an in-memory representation.
   - The variable `count` is used to store the number of ACL entries, which is obtained from the on-disk structure using the `be32_to_cpu` function.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The `count` variable is declared as an `int`, which is a signed integer type.
   - The value of `count` is obtained from the on-disk structure and converted to host byte order using `be32_to_cpu(aclp->acl_cnt)`.
   - The code checks if `count` exceeds `XFS_ACL_MAX_ENTRIES` to prevent excessive allocation.
   - However, since `count` is a signed integer, it can hold negative values. If `count` is negative, it can bypass the check `if (count > XFS_ACL_MAX_ENTRIES)` because negative values are less than `XFS_ACL_MAX_ENTRIES`.

3. **Potential Vulnerability:**
   - If `count` is negative, it can lead to an integer overflow when passed to `posix_acl_alloc(count, GFP_KERNEL)`.
   - The function `posix_acl_alloc` expects an unsigned integer for the number of entries. Passing a negative value can result in an unexpectedly large allocation size due to integer wraparound, leading to potential memory corruption or denial of service.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Changing the Data Type:**
   - To prevent the possibility of `count` being negative, we should change its type from `int` to `unsigned int`.
   - This ensures that `count` can only hold non-negative values, eliminating the risk of integer overflow due to negative values.

2. **Implementing the Fix:**
   - Modify the declaration of `count` and `i` to use `unsigned int` instead of `int`.

### Conclusion:
The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of a signed integer for the `count` variable, which can lead to integer overflow when negative values are involved. The fix involves changing the type of `count` to `unsigned int` to ensure it can only hold non-negative values, thus preventing the overflow.

### Patch:
```diff
< 	int count, i;
---
> 	unsigned int count, i;
```

By making this change, the code ensures that `count` is always non-negative, thereby preventing the integer overflow vulnerability when allocating memory for the ACL entries.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 MONGO_EXPORT int bson_append_code_n( bson *b, const char *name, const char *value, int len ) {
2     return bson_append_string_base( b, name, value, len, BSON_CODE );```
which has a CWE-190 vulnerability at line:
```
2     return bson_append_string_base( b, name, value, len, BSON_CODE );
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Function and Parameters:**
   - The function `bson_append_code_n` is designed to append a code string to a BSON object.
   - It takes four parameters:
     - `bson *b`: A pointer to the BSON object.
     - `const char *name`: The name of the field to append.
     - `const char *value`: The code string to append.
     - `int len`: The length of the code string.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is identified as CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound.
   - The parameter `len` is of type `int`, which is a signed integer. This means it can hold both positive and negative values.
   - If `len` is a large positive value, adding it to other integers or performing arithmetic operations could cause an integer overflow.
   - If `len` is negative, it could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues when used in functions that expect a non-negative length.

3. **Potential Impact:**
   - An integer overflow can lead to incorrect memory allocation, buffer overflows, or other undefined behaviors.
   - Using a negative length can cause functions to misinterpret the length, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Changing the Data Type:**
   - To prevent integer overflow and ensure that the length is always non-negative, we should change the data type of `len` from `int` to `size_t`.
   - `size_t` is an unsigned integer type that is used for sizes and counts. It is guaranteed to be non-negative and is typically used for array indexing and memory allocation sizes.

2. **Applying the Patch:**
   - Modify the function signature to change the type of `len` from `int` to `size_t`.

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that the length parameter is always non-negative and large enough to handle the maximum possible size without causing an overflow. This change mitigates the risk of CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound.

### Final Patch

```diff
< MONGO_EXPORT int bson_append_code_n( bson *b, const char *name, const char *value, int len ) {
---
> MONGO_EXPORT int bson_append_code_n( bson *b, const char *name, const char *value, size_t len ) {
```

By changing the type of `len` to `size_t`, we ensure that the length is always a valid, non-negative value, thus preventing potential integer overflow vulnerabilities.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 void lstcon_rpc_pinger(void *arg)
3     stt_timer_t *ptimer = (stt_timer_t *)arg;
14     if (console_session.ses_shutdown || console_session.ses_expired)
19     if (!console_session.ses_expired && cfs_time_current_sec() - console_session.ses_laststamp > (time_t)console_session.ses_timeout)
21         console_session.ses_expired = 1;
83     if (console_session.ses_expired)
89     ptimer->stt_expires = (cfs_time_t)(cfs_time_current_sec() + LST_PING_INTERVAL);```
which has a CWE-190 vulnerability at line:
```
89     ptimer->stt_expires = (cfs_time_t)(cfs_time_current_sec() + LST_PING_INTERVAL);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `lstcon_rpc_pinger` is responsible for updating the expiration time of a timer (`ptimer`).
   - The line in question is:
     ```c
     ptimer->stt_expires = (cfs_time_t)(cfs_time_current_sec() + LST_PING_INTERVAL);
     ```

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The potential vulnerability here is an integer overflow when adding `cfs_time_current_sec()` and `LST_PING_INTERVAL`.
   - If the sum of `cfs_time_current_sec()` and `LST_PING_INTERVAL` exceeds the maximum value that can be held by the type `cfs_time_t`, it will wrap around, leading to incorrect and potentially dangerous behavior.

3. **Data Types and Limits:**
   - `cfs_time_current_sec()` likely returns the current time in seconds as a `time_t` type.
   - `LST_PING_INTERVAL` is a constant interval added to the current time.
   - The type `cfs_time_t` needs to be examined. If it is a signed type, it has a maximum positive value it can hold. Exceeding this value will cause an overflow.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Choosing the Correct Data Type:**
   - To prevent overflow, we need to ensure that the result of the addition can be safely stored in the target type.
   - Using an unsigned type can help because it has a larger range of positive values compared to a signed type of the same size.

2. **Applying the Fix:**
   - Change the type cast to an unsigned type to prevent overflow. In this case, `unsigned long` is chosen, which typically has a larger range than `cfs_time_t` if `cfs_time_t` is a signed type.
   - The patch changes the type cast to `unsigned long` to ensure that the addition does not overflow.

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that the result of the addition is stored in a type that can handle larger values, thus preventing overflow. Here is the patch:

```diff
<     ptimer->stt_expires = (cfs_time_t)(cfs_time_current_sec() + LST_PING_INTERVAL);
---
>     ptimer->stt_expires = (unsigned long)(cfs_time_current_sec() + LST_PING_INTERVAL);
```

### Summary of Reasoning Steps:

1. **Identify the potential for integer overflow** in the addition operation.
2. **Understand the data types involved** and their limits.
3. **Choose a suitable data type** that can handle the result without overflow.
4. **Apply the fix** by changing the type cast to an unsigned type with a larger range.

By following these steps, we ensure that the code is safe from integer overflow vulnerabilities.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 int ksocknal_reaper(void *arg)
11     cfs_time_t deadline = cfs_time_current();```
which has a CWE-190 vulnerability at line:
```
11     cfs_time_t deadline = cfs_time_current();
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability in the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach. Here are the reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `ksocknal_reaper` is defined, and within it, a variable `deadline` is initialized using the function `cfs_time_current()`.
   - The type of `deadline` is `cfs_time_t`.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - CWE-190 refers to integer overflow or wraparound, which occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that exceeds the maximum value the data type can hold, causing it to wrap around to a much smaller value.
   - To identify the vulnerability, we need to understand the type `cfs_time_t` and the return type of `cfs_time_current()`.

3. **Analyzing `cfs_time_t` and `cfs_time_current()`:**
   - If `cfs_time_t` is a signed integer type, it has a limited range. When `cfs_time_current()` returns a large value, it could cause an overflow if the value exceeds the maximum representable value of `cfs_time_t`.
   - If `cfs_time_t` is an unsigned integer type, it still has a maximum value, but the risk of overflow is different (it wraps around to zero).

4. **Potential Overflow Scenario:**
   - If `cfs_time_t` is a signed type and `cfs_time_current()` returns a value close to the maximum positive value, adding any additional time to `deadline` could cause an overflow.
   - If `cfs_time_t` is an unsigned type, similar issues can occur if the value exceeds the maximum representable value.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Choosing an Appropriate Data Type:**
   - To prevent overflow, we need to ensure that the data type used for `deadline` can handle the values returned by `cfs_time_current()` without exceeding its limits.
   - Using a larger or more appropriate data type can help mitigate the risk of overflow.

2. **Patch Implementation:**
   - The patch changes the type of `deadline` from `cfs_time_t` to `unsigned long`. This suggests that `unsigned long` is a more appropriate type that can handle the values returned by `cfs_time_current()` without causing overflow.

### Conclusion

The patch changes the type of `deadline` to `unsigned long` to prevent potential overflow issues. Here is the reasoning for the patch:

- **Original Code:**
  ```c
  cfs_time_t deadline = cfs_time_current();
  ```

- **Patched Code:**
  ```c
  unsigned long deadline = cfs_time_current();
  ```

- **Reasoning:**
  - The original type `cfs_time_t` may not be able to handle the large values returned by `cfs_time_current()`, leading to potential overflow.
  - Changing the type to `unsigned long` ensures that `deadline` can store larger values, thus preventing overflow and ensuring the correct behavior of the program.

By following these steps, we ensure that the patch addresses the root cause of the vulnerability and prevents potential integer overflow issues.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int bson_string_is_db_ref( const unsigned char *string, const int length ) {
4     if( length >= 4 ) {```
which has a CWE-190 vulnerability at line:
```
4     if( length >= 4 ) {
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `bson_string_is_db_ref` takes two parameters: a pointer to an unsigned char array (`string`) and an integer (`length`).
   - The function checks if the `length` is greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is identified as CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound.
   - The issue arises because the `length` parameter is of type `int`. If `length` is a negative value, it can lead to unexpected behavior when performing comparisons or arithmetic operations.

3. **Potential Problem:**
   - If `length` is negative, the condition `length >= 4` might not behave as expected.
   - Negative values for `length` can lead to incorrect logic and potential security issues, especially if `length` is used in subsequent operations that assume it to be non-negative.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Changing the Data Type:**
   - To prevent negative values, we should use an unsigned data type for `length`.
   - The `size_t` type is an appropriate choice because it is an unsigned integer type that is used for representing sizes and counts, and it is guaranteed to be non-negative.

2. **Applying the Patch:**
   - Change the type of the `length` parameter from `int` to `size_t`.
   - This ensures that `length` cannot be negative, thus preventing the integer overflow or wraparound issue.

### Conclusion

The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of a signed integer type for the `length` parameter, which can lead to negative values and unexpected behavior. The fix involves changing the type to `size_t`, which is an unsigned type and ensures that `length` is always non-negative.

### Patch

The patch is as follows:
```diff
< static int bson_string_is_db_ref( const unsigned char *string, const int length ) {
---
> static int bson_string_is_db_ref( const unsigned char *string, const size_t length ) {
```

This change ensures that the `length` parameter is always non-negative, thus preventing the CWE-190 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 int crush_remove_list_bucket_item(struct crush_bucket_list *bucket, int item)
3     int i, j;```
which has a CWE-190 vulnerability at line:
```
3     int i, j;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To address the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability in the given code slice, we need to follow a systematic approach to identify the root cause and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the reasoning steps for generating the patch:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Context**:
   - The function `crush_remove_list_bucket_item` is defined to remove an item from a list bucket.
   - The variables `i` and `j` are declared as integers.

2. **Potential Vulnerability**:
   - CWE-190 refers to integer overflow or wraparound, which occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that exceeds the maximum or minimum value that can be represented by the integer type.
   - In this context, if `i` or `j` are used in arithmetic operations or as array indices, there is a risk that they could overflow, especially if they are incremented or decremented in loops.

3. **Risk of Overflow**:
   - If `i` or `j` are used in loops or arithmetic operations, and if they are incremented beyond the maximum value representable by an `int`, they will wrap around to a negative value, leading to undefined behavior.
   - This can cause out-of-bounds access, incorrect logic, or crashes.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Choosing the Appropriate Data Type**:
   - To prevent integer overflow, we can use an unsigned integer type. Unsigned integers do not wrap around to negative values; instead, they wrap around to zero, which is often safer in the context of array indexing and loop counters.
   - By changing the type of `i` and `j` to `unsigned`, we ensure that they can only represent non-negative values, reducing the risk of overflow.

2. **Applying the Patch**:
   - Change the declaration of `i` and `j` from `int` to `unsigned`.

### Conclusion

The patch changes the type of `i` and `j` to `unsigned`, which mitigates the risk of integer overflow by ensuring that these variables can only hold non-negative values. This is a common and effective strategy to prevent CWE-190 vulnerabilities in scenarios where negative values are not meaningful or expected.

### Patch

```diff
<     int i, j;
---
>     unsigned i, j;
```

By following these reasoning steps, we ensure that the code is more robust and less prone to integer overflow vulnerabilities.
