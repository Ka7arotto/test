A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `info` structure, but there is no check for the size of the structure being allocated. If the size of the `info` structure is not properly calculated or if it changes in the future, allocating memory based on `sizeof(*info)` may lead to insufficient memory allocation or an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
