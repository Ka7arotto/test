A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `memcpy` function is used to copy data from the `nbuf` buffer to the `pi` structure without checking if the size of the data being copied (`descsz`) exceeds the boundaries of the `nbuf` buffer starting at the offset `doff`. If `descsz` is larger than the available data in `nbuf` starting at `doff`, it can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
