A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `btrfs_double_lock` function is called with parameters `loff` and `dst_loff` without validating if they are within the bounds of the respective inodes `src` and `dst`. If these parameters are not properly validated, it can lead to accessing memory out of bounds, resulting in a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
