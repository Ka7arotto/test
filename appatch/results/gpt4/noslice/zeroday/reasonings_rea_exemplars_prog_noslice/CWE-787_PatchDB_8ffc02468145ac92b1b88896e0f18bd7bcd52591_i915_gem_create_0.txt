A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, there doesn't seem to be a CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability in this code slice. The function `i915_gem_alloc_object` is called with the `size` parameter, which is rounded up to the nearest `PAGE_SIZE`. This ensures that the allocated object size is aligned correctly. Therefore, the root cause of the vulnerability is not applicable in this code slice.
