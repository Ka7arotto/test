Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for `cc->tfms` based on `cc->tfms_count`, but there is no check to ensure that `cc->tfms_count` is a valid value. If `cc->tfms_count` is not properly validated and is a large value, it can lead to allocating a memory size that exceeds the intended bounds, resulting in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
