Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the `protocol_name_len` variable is assigned the result of `strlen(protocol_name)`, which returns an unsigned integer type `size_t`. If the length of `protocol_name` is very large, it may exceed the maximum value that can be stored in an `unsigned int` type, potentially causing an integer overflow or wraparound vulnerability. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
