Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `sps_id` field of the `pps` structure is being checked for being greater than or equal to 16 without verifying if it is within the valid range. If `sps_id` is not properly bounded, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.
