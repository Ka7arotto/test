Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the value returned by `ReadBlobByte(image)` is cast to `MagickSizeType` without proper validation or checking. If the value returned by `ReadBlobByte(image)` is a large positive value, casting it to `MagickSizeType` may result in an integer overflow, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is essential to ensure that the value being cast to `MagickSizeType` is within the valid range to prevent integer overflow vulnerabilities.
