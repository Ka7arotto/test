A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `tm` pointer returned by `localtime(&t)` is being passed directly to `asctime()` without checking if it is NULL. If `localtime()` fails and returns NULL, passing a NULL pointer to `asctime()` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
