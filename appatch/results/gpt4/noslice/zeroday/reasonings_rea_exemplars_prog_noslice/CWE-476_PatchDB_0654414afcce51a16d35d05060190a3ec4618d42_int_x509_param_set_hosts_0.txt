A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `name` pointer is being used without being checked for NULL before passing it to `memchr`. If `name` is NULL, dereferencing it to check for the null terminator will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
