A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `rinfo` array without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, accessing the `rinfo` array can lead to undefined behavior, including potential out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities, which is CWE-787.
