Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the memory allocation for `fl->fh_array` at line 49 may not allocate enough memory for `fl->fh_array` based on the value of `fl->num_fh`. If `fl->num_fh` is larger than the allocated memory size, it can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when accessing elements beyond the allocated memory, which is CWE-787.
