A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is used to reallocate memory for the `data` pointer without checking if the reallocation was successful. If `realloc` fails to allocate the requested memory, it returns NULL, which can lead to a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability when dereferencing the NULL pointer. This can result in undefined behavior and security risks.
