A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `alloc_bytes` function is used to allocate memory for the `array` without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, accessing the `array` can lead to undefined behavior, including potential out-of-bounds writes, which is a security risk.
