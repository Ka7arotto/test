Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `buflen` variable is used to access the `buf` array at index `buflen` to add a null terminator. If `buflen` is equal to or greater than the size of the `buf` array, then writing the null terminator at `buf[buflen]` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
