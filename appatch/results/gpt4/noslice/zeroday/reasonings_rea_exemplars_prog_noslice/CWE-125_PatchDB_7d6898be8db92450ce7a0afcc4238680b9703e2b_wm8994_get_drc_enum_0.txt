A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the `drc` variable is used as an index to access the `drc_cfg` array without proper bounds checking. If `drc` is not a valid index within the bounds of the `drc_cfg` array, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.
