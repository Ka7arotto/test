A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for `group` based on the size of `fsnotify_group` struct. However, the correct way to allocate memory for a struct is `sizeof(struct fsnotify_group)` instead of `sizeof(fsnotify_group)`. This mistake can lead to allocating less memory than required, potentially causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
