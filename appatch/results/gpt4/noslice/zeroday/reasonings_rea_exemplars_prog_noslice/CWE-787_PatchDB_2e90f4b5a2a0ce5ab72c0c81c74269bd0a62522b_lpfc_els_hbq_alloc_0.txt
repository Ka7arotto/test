A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for `hbqbp` based on the size of `hbq_dmabuf` struct, but it should be `sizeof(struct hbq_dmabuf)` instead of `sizeof(hbq_dmabuf)`. This mistake can lead to allocating less memory than required, potentially causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
