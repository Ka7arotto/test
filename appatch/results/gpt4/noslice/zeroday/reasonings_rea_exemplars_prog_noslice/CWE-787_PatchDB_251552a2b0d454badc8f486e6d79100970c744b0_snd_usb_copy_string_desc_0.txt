A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `buf` array is accessed at index `len` without checking if `len` is within the bounds of the `buf` array. If the value of `len` is equal to or greater than `maxlen`, then writing to `buf[len]` will result in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
