A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it is directly accessing `d_table->size` without first checking if `d_table` itself is NULL. If `d_table` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `size` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
