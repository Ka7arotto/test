Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the expression `(arg * HZ) / 1000` may result in an integer overflow if the multiplication of `arg` and `HZ` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the data type used for `cyz_polling_cycle`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
