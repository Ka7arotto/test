A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `malloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `buf` array without checking if the allocation was successful. If `malloc` fails to allocate memory due to insufficient memory available, it will return `NULL`, and using this `NULL` pointer without validation can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
