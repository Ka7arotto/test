Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the loop condition is directly accessing the `password` pointer without first checking if it is NULL. If `password` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `password[i]` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, which is CWE-476.
