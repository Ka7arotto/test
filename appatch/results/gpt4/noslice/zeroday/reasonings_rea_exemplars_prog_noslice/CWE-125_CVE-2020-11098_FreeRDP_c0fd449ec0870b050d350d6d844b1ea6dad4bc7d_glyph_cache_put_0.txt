Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `index` is used to access the `entries` array within `glyphCache->glyphCache[id]` without proper bounds checking. If `index` is greater than the number of entries in the cache, it will lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.
