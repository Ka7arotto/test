A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `offset` variable is being incremented by `file->f_pos` without any bounds checking. If `file->f_pos` is larger than the maximum allowable value for `offset`, it can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
