A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the `strlen` function returns a value of type `size_t`, which is an unsigned integer type. However, the result is being stored in an `unsigned int` variable `str_len`. If the length of the string `str` is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in an `unsigned int`, it may lead to an integer overflow, causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
