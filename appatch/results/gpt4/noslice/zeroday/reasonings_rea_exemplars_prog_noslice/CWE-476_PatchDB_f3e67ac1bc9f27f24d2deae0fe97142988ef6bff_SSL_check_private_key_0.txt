A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it directly accesses `ssl->cert->key->x509` without checking if any of these pointers (`ssl`, `cert`, `key`) are NULL. If any of these pointers are NULL, dereferencing them to access `x509` will result in a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability, which is CWE-476.
