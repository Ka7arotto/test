Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `out_len` variable is assigned the value of `cipher_len - 2`, which could potentially be negative if `cipher_len` is less than 2. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability if `out_len` is used to write data beyond the bounds of the output buffer `out`, which is CWE-787.
