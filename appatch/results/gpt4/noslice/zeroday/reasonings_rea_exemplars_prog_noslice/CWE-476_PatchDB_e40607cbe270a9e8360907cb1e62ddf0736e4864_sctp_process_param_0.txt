Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it is directly calling the `from_addr_param` function of the `af` structure without first checking if `af` itself is NULL. If `af` is NULL, dereferencing it to call `from_addr_param` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
