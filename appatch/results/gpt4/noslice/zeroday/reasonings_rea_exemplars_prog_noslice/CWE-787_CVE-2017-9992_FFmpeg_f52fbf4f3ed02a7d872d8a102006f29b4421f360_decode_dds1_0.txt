Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the code is attempting to write to `frame` array elements without proper boundary checks. Specifically, the code is trying to write to `frame[0]` and `frame[1]` without ensuring that there is enough space in the `frame` array to accommodate these writes. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
