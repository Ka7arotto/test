Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because there is a potential memory leak when the `rtsp_st` structure is being checked for certain conditions at line 12, but there is no corresponding deallocation of memory before the function returns. This can lead to memory leakage, which is a violation of CWE-401.
