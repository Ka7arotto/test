A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the `tmp` variable is being freed at line 26, but it is reassigned a new value at line 28 without freeing the previous memory allocation. This can lead to memory leaks as the previously allocated memory for `tmp` is lost and not released before the function returns.
