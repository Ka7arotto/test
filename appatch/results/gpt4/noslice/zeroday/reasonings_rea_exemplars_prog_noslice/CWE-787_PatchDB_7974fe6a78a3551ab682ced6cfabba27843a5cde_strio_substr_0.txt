A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the function `rb_enc_str_new` is used to create a new Ruby string from the substring of `str` starting at position `pos` with a length of `len`. If the value of `len` is not properly validated and exceeds the available length of the substring (`rlen`), it can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
