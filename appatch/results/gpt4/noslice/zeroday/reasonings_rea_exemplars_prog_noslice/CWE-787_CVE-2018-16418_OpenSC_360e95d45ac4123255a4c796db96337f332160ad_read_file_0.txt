A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is used to reallocate memory for the `p` pointer, which points to the `data` array. If the reallocation fails (returns NULL), the original memory pointed to by `data` is not freed, leading to a memory leak. Additionally, if the reallocation results in a smaller memory block than the original, it can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when writing data to the newly allocated memory block, which is CWE-787.
