A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `realloc` function is used to reallocate memory for the `data` pointer without checking if the reallocation was successful. If `realloc` fails to allocate the requested memory, it returns NULL, and if `p` is assigned NULL without freeing the previous memory pointed to by `data`, it can lead to a memory leak and potential out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities. This is a common mistake that can result in memory corruption and security risks.
