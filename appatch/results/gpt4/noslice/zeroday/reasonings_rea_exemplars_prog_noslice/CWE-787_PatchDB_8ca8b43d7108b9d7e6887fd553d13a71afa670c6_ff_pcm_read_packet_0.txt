A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `size` variable is calculated as `RAW_SAMPLES * s->streams[0]->codec->block_align`, but there is no validation or check to ensure that the calculated `size` does not exceed the bounds of the `pkt` buffer. If the calculated `size` is larger than the buffer size allocated for `pkt`, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability can occur when `av_get_packet` writes data beyond the bounds of the `pkt` buffer, which is CWE-787.
