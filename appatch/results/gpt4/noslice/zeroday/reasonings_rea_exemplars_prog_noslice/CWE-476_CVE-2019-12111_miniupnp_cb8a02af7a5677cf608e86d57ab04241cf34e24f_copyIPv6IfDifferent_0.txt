A: Root Cause Analysis: In this code slice, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability does not exist. The `copyIPv6IfDifferent` function checks if `dest` is not equal to `src` before performing the `memcpy` operation. This check ensures that the `memcpy` operation is only executed when `dest` and `src` are not pointing to the same memory location, preventing any potential NULL pointer dereference issues.
