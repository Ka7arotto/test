A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `rule_buf` buffer is allocated using `kmalloc` based on the `info.rule_cnt` value without checking if the multiplication of `info.rule_cnt * sizeof(u32)` exceeds the `KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE`. If the result of this multiplication exceeds the `KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE`, it can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
