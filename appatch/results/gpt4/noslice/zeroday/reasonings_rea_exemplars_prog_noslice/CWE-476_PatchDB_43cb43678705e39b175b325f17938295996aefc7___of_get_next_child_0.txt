A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it assumes that either `prev` or `node` is not NULL when accessing their respective fields (`prev->sibling` and `node->child`). If `prev` is NULL and the ternary operator chooses `prev->sibling`, or if `node` is NULL and the ternary operator chooses `node->child`, a NULL pointer dereference will occur, leading to the vulnerability.
