A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `memset` function is used to copy data from `from` to `to` without checking the bounds of the `to` buffer. If the `count` parameter is larger than the size of the `to` buffer, it can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
