A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for `rp`, but the size allocated is based on the size of the pointer `rp` rather than the size of the `struct resource` structure. This can lead to insufficient memory allocation, potentially causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when accessing the `rp` structure members.
