A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for `iu` without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, `iu` will be NULL, leading to potential issues when `usb_fill_bulk_urb` is called with `iu` as a parameter. This can result in unexpected behavior or crashes due to accessing memory that was not properly allocated, which is a security risk.
