Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the code is directly accessing `seig_entry->key_info` without first checking if `seig_entry` itself is NULL. If `seig_entry` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `key_info` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
