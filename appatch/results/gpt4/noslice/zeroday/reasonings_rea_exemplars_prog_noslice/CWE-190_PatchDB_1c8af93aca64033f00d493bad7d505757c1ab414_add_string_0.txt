Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `depth` is declared as an `int` type. If the `depth` variable is used in calculations involving unsigned types or operations that may result in values exceeding the maximum positive value that can be represented by an `int`, it can lead to integer overflow or wraparound vulnerabilities. This can potentially cause unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
