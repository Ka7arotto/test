A: Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `tbl` pointer is being dereferenced without being checked for NULL after the memory allocation at line 15. If the memory allocation fails and `tbl` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `tbl->it_index`, `offset`, and `size` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
