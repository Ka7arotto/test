Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because when the allocation for `root_ops` fails at line 12, the allocated memory for `ri` is not freed before returning NULL at line 15. This can lead to a memory leak as the memory allocated for `ri` is not released before the function exits.
