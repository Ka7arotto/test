```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a systematic approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `gf_media_vvc_read_pps_bs_internal` reads data from a bitstream (`bs`) and processes it into a `VVCState` structure (`vvc`).
   - The variable `pps_id` is read from the bitstream and is expected to be within the range `[0, 63]` (as indicated by the check `if ((pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64))`).
   - The `pps` pointer is then set to point to the `pps_id`-th element of the `pps` array within the `vvc` structure.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The line `pps->sps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "sps_id");` reads a value for `sps_id` from the bitstream.
   - The subsequent check `if (pps->sps_id >= 16)` ensures that `sps_id` is within the range `[0, 15]`.
   - However, there is no check to ensure that `sps_id` is non-negative. If `sps_id` is negative, it could lead to undefined behavior when `pps->sps_id` is used later in the code.

3. **Potential Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability arises if `sps_id` is negative. This could lead to out-of-bounds access or other undefined behavior when `pps->sps_id` is used.
   - This is a classic example of a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. Reading or using a negative index can lead to accessing memory outside the intended bounds, potentially causing crashes or security issues.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `sps_id` is within the valid range `[0, 15]`. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that `sps_id` is non-negative.

### Conclusion

The vulnerable behavior in this code is an out-of-bounds read. It occurs because the code does not ensure that `sps_id` is non-negative. If `sps_id` is negative, it can lead to undefined behavior when `pps->sps_id` is used. Proper bounds checking should be added to ensure `sps_id` is within the valid range `[0, 15]`.

### Patch

The patch should add a check to ensure that `sps_id` is non-negative. The modified code should look like this:

```diff
< 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
---
> 	if ((pps->sps_id < 0) || (pps->sps_id >= 16)) {
```

### Summary

1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - The vulnerability is due to the lack of a check for negative values of `sps_id`.
   - This can lead to out-of-bounds access or undefined behavior.

2. **Fixing Strategy:**
   - Add a check to ensure that `sps_id` is non-negative and within the valid range `[0, 15]`.

By following these steps, we ensure that the code is robust and free from the CWE-125 vulnerability.

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `gf_hevc_read_pps_bs_internal` reads data from a bitstream and processes it to update the HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) state.
   - The variable `pps_id` is read from the bitstream using `gf_bs_read_ue_log`.
   - The `pps_id` is then used to index into the `hevc->pps` array.
   - The `pps->sps_id` is also read from the bitstream and is checked against a boundary condition.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is identified at line 21: `if (pps->sps_id >= 16)`.
   - This line checks if `pps->sps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, but it does not check if `pps->sps_id` is negative.
   - If `pps->sps_id` is negative, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read or write, which is a classic example of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read).

3. **Potential Impact:**
   - If `pps->sps_id` is negative, accessing `pps->sps_id` could lead to undefined behavior, including reading or writing to unintended memory locations.
   - This can cause crashes, data corruption, or even security vulnerabilities if exploited.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Adding Proper Bounds Checking:**
   - To prevent the out-of-bounds access, we need to ensure that `pps->sps_id` is within the valid range.
   - The valid range for `pps->sps_id` should be between 0 and 15 (inclusive), as indicated by the original check `pps->sps_id >= 16`.

2. **Implementing the Fix:**
   - We need to add a check to ensure that `pps->sps_id` is not negative.
   - The condition should be updated to check if `pps->sps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 16.

### Conclusion

The patch should add a check to ensure `pps->sps_id` is within the valid range (0 to 15). The updated condition will prevent out-of-bounds access by ensuring `pps->sps_id` is not negative.

### Patch Implementation

The patch is as follows:
```diff
< 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
---
> 	if ((pps->sps_id < 0) || (pps->sps_id >= 16)) {
```

### Reasoning for the Patch

- **Original Condition:**
  ```c
  if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
  ```
  - This only checks if `pps->sps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, missing the case where `pps->sps_id` could be negative.

- **Updated Condition:**
  ```c
  if ((pps->sps_id < 0) || (pps->sps_id >= 16)) {
  ```
  - This ensures that `pps->sps_id` is within the valid range (0 to 15).
  - By adding the check `pps->sps_id < 0`, we prevent negative values, which could lead to out-of-bounds access.

By following these reasoning steps, we ensure that the code is robust against out-of-bounds access, thereby mitigating the CWE-125 vulnerability.

Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds read) vulnerability in the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `read_private_key` is responsible for reading a private key, presumably from a file associated with an RSA structure.
   - The variable `bufsize` is assigned the size of the file (`file->size`) at line 26.

2. **Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities:**
   - The variable `file` is a pointer to `sc_file_t`, which is likely a structure representing a file.
   - The size of the file (`file->size`) is used to set `bufsize`.

3. **Analyzing the Vulnerability:**
   - If `file->size` is larger than the buffer intended to hold the file's contents, this can lead to an out-of-bounds read when the buffer is accessed.
   - The code does not currently check if `file->size` exceeds the size of the buffer that will be used to read the file's contents.

4. **Potential Consequences:**
   - If `bufsize` is set to a value larger than the actual buffer size, subsequent operations that read from the buffer could access memory beyond the allocated buffer, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Ensuring Safe Buffer Size:**
   - To prevent out-of-bounds reads, we need to ensure that `bufsize` does not exceed the size of the buffer that will be used to read the file's contents.
   - This can be achieved by taking the minimum of `file->size` and the actual buffer size.

2. **Applying the Fix:**
   - The `MIN` macro (or function) can be used to set `bufsize` to the smaller of `file->size` and the buffer size.
   - This ensures that `bufsize` will not exceed the buffer size, preventing out-of-bounds reads.

### Conclusion

The vulnerable behavior in this code is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs because `bufsize` is set directly to `file->size` without checking if it exceeds the buffer size. To fix this, we need to ensure that `bufsize` is the minimum of `file->size` and the buffer size.

### Patch

The patch ensures that `bufsize` is set to the smaller of `file->size` and the buffer size, preventing out-of-bounds reads:

```diff
<     bufsize = file->size;
---
>     bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```

### Explanation of the Patch

- `MIN(file->size, sizeof buf)` ensures that `bufsize` will not exceed the size of the buffer `buf`.
- This prevents any potential out-of-bounds read by ensuring that `bufsize` is always within the bounds of the allocated buffer.

By following these reasoning steps, we can understand the root cause of the vulnerability and apply an appropriate fix to ensure safe and secure code execution.

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `gf_hevc_read_vps_bs_internal` reads a value `vps_id` from a bitstream and uses it to index into an array `hevc->vps`.
   - The function reads `vps_id` using `gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id")`, which reads a 4-bit integer from the bitstream.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16 (`if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;`).
   - However, it does not check if `vps_id` is less than 0.
   - If `vps_id` is negative, the expression `hevc->vps[vps_id]` at line 14 will result in an out-of-bounds access, leading to a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

3. **Potential Impact:**
   - Accessing an array with a negative index can lead to reading from unintended memory locations.
   - This can cause undefined behavior, crashes, or potential information leakage.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Ensuring Valid Index Range:**
   - To prevent out-of-bounds access, we need to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `hevc->vps` array.
   - The valid range for `vps_id` should be from 0 to 15 (inclusive), as the array size is 16.

2. **Updating the Condition:**
   - The current condition only checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16.
   - We need to add an additional check to ensure `vps_id` is not negative.

3. **Applying the Patch:**
   - Modify the condition to check if `vps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 16.
   - If either condition is true, return -1 to indicate an error.

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range of 0 to 15 before accessing the `hevc->vps` array. This prevents out-of-bounds access and mitigates the CWE-125 vulnerability.

### Final Patch

```diff
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

### Summary

- **Root Cause:** The code does not check if `vps_id` is negative, leading to potential out-of-bounds access.
- **Fix:** Add a condition to ensure `vps_id` is not negative before accessing the array.
- **Patch:** Update the condition to `if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;` to ensure `vps_id` is within the valid range.

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a systematic approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `gf_hevc_read_sps_bs_internal` reads some data from a bitstream (`bs`) and processes it within the context of an HEVC (High-Efficiency Video Coding) state (`hevc`).
   - The variable `vps_id` is read from the bitstream using the function `gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id")`.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerable Behavior:**
   - The code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16 (`if (vps_id >= 16)`). If this condition is true, it likely handles the error or exits the function.
   - However, there is no check to ensure that `vps_id` is non-negative. This means that if `vps_id` is negative, the subsequent access to `hevc->vps[vps_id]` at line 43 will result in an out-of-bounds read.

3. **Potential Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability here is a classic example of CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read. If `vps_id` is negative, accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]` will read memory outside the bounds of the `vps` array, leading to undefined behavior and potential security issues.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Ensuring Valid Index Range:**
   - To prevent out-of-bounds access, we need to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `vps` array.
   - The valid range for `vps_id` should be from 0 to 15 (inclusive), as indicated by the existing check `if (vps_id >= 16)`.

2. **Adding a Check for Negative Values:**
   - We need to add a condition to check if `vps_id` is negative. This can be done by modifying the existing condition to include a check for `vps_id < 0`.

3. **Implementing the Patch:**
   - The patch should modify the condition to ensure `vps_id` is within the range [0, 15]. This can be achieved by changing the condition to `if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16))`.

### Conclusion

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of a check for negative values of `vps_id`, which can lead to out-of-bounds access. The patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range by adding a check for negative values.

### Final Patch

The final patch is as follows:
```diff
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) {
---
> 	if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) {
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range [0, 15], thereby preventing out-of-bounds access and mitigating the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```

2 {
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
7     return 0;
8 }```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach that includes root cause analysis and a fixing strategy. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `wm8994_get_drc_enum` retrieves a value from the `wm8994` structure and assigns it to `ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0]`.
   - The `drc` value is obtained by calling `wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name)`.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The line `ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];` accesses the `drc_cfg` array using the index `drc`.
   - If `drc` is out of the valid range for the `drc_cfg` array, this will lead to a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

3. **Potential Issues with `drc`:**
   - The function `wm8994_get_drc` returns an integer value based on `kcontrol->id.name`.
   - If `wm8994_get_drc` returns a negative value or a value that exceeds the bounds of the `drc_cfg` array, it will result in an out-of-bounds access.

4. **Validating `drc`:**
   - To prevent out-of-bounds access, we need to ensure that `drc` is within the valid range of indices for the `drc_cfg` array.
   - Typically, a negative value for `drc` is invalid and should be handled appropriately.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Adding a Check for `drc`:**
   - Before accessing the `drc_cfg` array, we need to check if `drc` is a valid index.
   - If `drc` is negative, it indicates an invalid value, and we should handle this case by returning an error code.

2. **Implementing the Patch:**
   - Add a condition to check if `drc` is negative.
   - If `drc` is negative, return the `drc` value as an error code.
   - If `drc` is valid, proceed with accessing the `drc_cfg` array.

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that the `drc` value is validated before it is used to index the `drc_cfg` array, thus preventing out-of-bounds access. Here is the patched code with the added validation:

```c
<     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
<     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
---
>     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (drc < 0)
>     {
>         return drc;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```

### Detailed Reasoning for the Patch:

1. **Retrieve `drc` Value:**
   - `int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);`
   - This line retrieves the `drc` value based on the `kcontrol->id.name`.

2. **Check for Negative `drc`:**
   - `if (drc < 0)`
   - This condition checks if `drc` is negative, which would indicate an invalid index.

3. **Return Error Code:**
   - `return drc;`
   - If `drc` is negative, return it as an error code to indicate the invalid value.

4. **Access `drc_cfg` Array:**
   - `ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];`
   - This line is executed only if `drc` is valid, ensuring safe access to the `drc_cfg` array.

By following these steps, the patch effectively mitigates the CWE-125 vulnerability by ensuring that the `drc` value is within the valid range before accessing the `drc_cfg` array.

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `hevc_parse_slice_segment` is parsing a slice segment from a bitstream.
   - `pps_id` is read from the bitstream using the function `gf_bs_read_ue_log`.
   - `pps_id` is then used to index into the `hevc->pps` array.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The line `pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];` accesses the `pps` array using `pps_id`.
   - The array `hevc->pps` has a fixed size, and accessing it with an out-of-bounds index can lead to undefined behavior, which is a classic example of CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read.

3. **Analyzing the Bounds Check:**
   - The current code checks if `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64 (`if (pps_id >= 64)`).
   - However, it does not check if `pps_id` is negative. If `pps_id` is negative, it will still lead to an out-of-bounds access.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Adding a Lower Bound Check:**
   - To prevent out-of-bounds access, we need to ensure that `pps_id` is within the valid range of the array indices.
   - The valid range for `pps_id` should be from 0 to 63 (inclusive), assuming the array size is 64.

2. **Implementing the Fix:**
   - Modify the condition to check both the lower and upper bounds of `pps_id`.
   - The new condition should ensure that `pps_id` is not negative and is less than 64.

### Conclusion

The vulnerability arises because the code does not check if `pps_id` is negative, leading to potential out-of-bounds access. The fix involves adding a lower bound check to ensure `pps_id` is within the valid range of array indices.

### Patch Implementation

The patch modifies the condition to include a check for negative values of `pps_id`:

```diff
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

### Summary

- **Root Cause:** The code does not check if `pps_id` is negative, leading to potential out-of-bounds access.
- **Fix:** Add a lower bound check to ensure `pps_id` is within the valid range (0 to 63).

By following these reasoning steps, we can ensure that the patch effectively addresses the CWE-125 vulnerability by preventing out-of-bounds access to the `hevc->pps` array.

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a systematic approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `vvc_parse_picture_header` reads various fields from a bitstream `bs` and updates the `VVCSliceInfo` structure `si`.
   - The variable `pps_id` is read from the bitstream using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id")`.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The line `si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];` assigns a pointer to an element in the `pps` array of the `VVCState` structure `vvc`.
   - The array `pps` has a fixed size, and accessing an element outside its bounds can lead to undefined behavior, which is a classic example of CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read.

3. **Analyzing the Bounds Check:**
   - The code checks if `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64 with the condition `if (pps_id >= 64)`.
   - However, this check is incomplete because it does not account for negative values of `pps_id`.

4. **Potential Vulnerability:**
   - If `pps_id` is negative, the expression `vvc->pps[pps_id]` will access memory before the start of the `pps` array, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
   - This can cause memory corruption, crashes, or other unpredictable behavior.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

To prevent the out-of-bounds read, we need to ensure that `pps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `pps` array. The valid range is from 0 to 63 (inclusive), assuming the array has 64 elements.

1. **Adding a Lower Bound Check:**
   - We need to add a check to ensure that `pps_id` is not negative.

2. **Combining the Checks:**
   - The condition should ensure that `pps_id` is both non-negative and less than 64.

### Step 3: Applying the Patch

The patch should modify the condition to include the lower bound check:

```diff
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that `pps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `pps` array, preventing out-of-bounds access. Here is the reasoning summarized:

1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - The vulnerability is due to an incomplete bounds check on `pps_id`.
   - Negative values of `pps_id` can lead to out-of-bounds read.

2. **Fixing Strategy:**
   - Add a lower bound check to ensure `pps_id` is non-negative.
   - Combine the lower and upper bound checks in a single condition.

3. **Patch:**
   - Modify the condition to `if ((pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64))`.

By following these steps, we ensure that the code correctly handles the bounds of the `pps` array, preventing potential out-of-bounds access and improving the overall security and stability of the function.

```
7     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach that includes root cause analysis and a fixing strategy. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `ecall` takes two parameters: a pointer to `mrb_state` and an integer `i`.
   - The variable `p` is a pointer to a `struct RProc`.
   - The line `p = mrb->c->ensure[i];` attempts to access the `i`-th element of the `ensure` array within the `c` structure of `mrb`.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is a CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read.
   - This occurs when the code attempts to read from an array index that is outside the valid range of the array.

3. **Potential Issues:**
   - If `i` is negative, accessing `mrb->c->ensure[i]` will result in undefined behavior because array indices must be non-negative.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to the size of the `ensure` array, it will also result in an out-of-bounds read.

4. **Determining the Root Cause:**
   - The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of bounds checking on the index `i` before accessing the `ensure` array.
   - Specifically, there is no check to ensure that `i` is within the valid range of indices for the `ensure` array.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Adding Bounds Checking:**
   - To prevent out-of-bounds access, we need to add a check to ensure that `i` is non-negative.
   - Additionally, we should ensure that `i` is within the valid range of the `ensure` array. However, the provided patch only addresses the negative index issue.

2. **Implementing the Fix:**
   - The patch introduces a condition to check if `i` is negative.
   - If `i` is negative, the function returns early, preventing the out-of-bounds access.

3. **Patch Implementation:**
   - The original code:
     ```c
     struct RObject *exc;
     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
     ```
   - The patched code:
     ```c
     struct RObject *exc;
     if (i < 0)
     {
         return;
     }
     p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
     ```

### Conclusion

The patch addresses the CWE-125 vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that the index `i` is non-negative before accessing the `ensure` array. This prevents out-of-bounds read when `i` is negative. However, it is important to note that the patch does not address the case where `i` is greater than or equal to the size of the `ensure` array. A more comprehensive fix would include a check to ensure `i` is within the valid range of the array.

### Comprehensive Fix (Optional)

To fully address the out-of-bounds read vulnerability, the patch should also include a check to ensure `i` is within the valid range of the `ensure` array. Assuming we have access to the size of the `ensure` array, the comprehensive fix would look like this:

```c
struct RObject *exc;
if (i < 0 || i >= ensure_array_size) // ensure_array_size should be the actual size of the ensure array
{
    return;
}
p = mrb->c->ensure[i];
```

This ensures that `i` is both non-negative and within the bounds of the `ensure` array, fully mitigating the CWE-125 vulnerability.
