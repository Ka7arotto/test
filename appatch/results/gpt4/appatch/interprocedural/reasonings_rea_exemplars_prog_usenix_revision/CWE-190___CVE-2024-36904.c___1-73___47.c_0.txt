The CWE-190 vulnerability, commonly known as an Integer Overflow or Wraparound, can occur when an integer operation results in a value that is outside the allowable range of the data type. In the provided code snippet, the vulnerability is identified at line 6 within the `overlapping` function. Let's analyze the potential for integer overflow step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable Definitions and Calculations**:
   ```c
   const BYTE* pDstStart = &pDstData[nXDst * dstBytesPerPixel + nYDst * nDstStep];
   ```
   Here, `pDstStart` is calculated by offsetting `pDstData` by the computed index `nXDst * dstBytesPerPixel + nYDst * nDstStep`.

2. **Potential for Overflow**:
   - `nXDst * dstBytesPerPixel`: This multiplication could overflow if `nXDst` or `dstBytesPerPixel` is large. `dstBytesPerPixel` is derived from `DstFormat` and represents the number of bytes per pixel, which typically ranges from 1 to 4 for common image formats.
   - `nYDst * nDstStep`: Similarly, this multiplication could also overflow if `nYDst` or `nDstStep` is large. `nDstStep` typically represents the width of the image in bytes (which could be quite large for high-resolution images).

3. **Summation of Products**:
   - Adding the results of `nXDst * dstBytesPerPixel` and `nYDst * nDstStep` could further increase the risk of exceeding the maximum value that can be held by the data type (assuming it's a 32-bit integer, the maximum value is 2^31 - 1 for signed integers).

4. **Memory Address Calculation**:
   - The result of this potentially overflowing calculation is used as an index to access `pDstData`. If an overflow occurs, the calculated index might wrap around to a lower value, leading to an incorrect memory address being accessed. This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, potentially corrupting data or causing crashes.

### Conclusion:
The vulnerability arises due to the lack of checks on the values of `nXDst`, `nYDst`, `dstBytesPerPixel`, and `nDstStep` before performing arithmetic operations. These operations could result in integer overflows, leading to incorrect memory address calculations and potential out-of-bounds memory access.

### Mitigation:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should include checks to ensure that the calculations do not result in overflow:
- Validate that `nXDst`, `nYDst`, `dstBytesPerPixel`, and `nDstStep` are within safe limits before performing the calculations.
- Use data types that can handle larger values (e.g., `uint64_t`) for calculations involving image dimensions and pixel data.
- Implement safe arithmetic operations that check for overflow before performing the actual calculation.
