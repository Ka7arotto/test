To generate the patch for the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability in the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach. Here are the reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Identify the Vulnerability:**
   - CWE-401 refers to a memory leak, which occurs when memory is allocated but not properly deallocated, leading to wasted memory resources.

2. **Examine Memory Allocation:**
   - At line 14, memory is allocated to `output` using `uml_kmalloc`:
     ```c
     output = uml_kmalloc(output_len, UM_GFP_KERNEL);
     ```
   - This allocation needs to be properly freed to avoid a memory leak.

3. **Check for Early Returns:**
   - The function has an early return at line 23:
     ```c
     return;
     ```
   - If the function returns early, the allocated memory for `output` will not be freed, leading to a memory leak.

4. **Determine Conditions for Early Return:**
   - The early return occurs if `pid < 0`:
     ```c
     if (pid < 0)
     {
         return;
     }
     ```
   - Before this check, `output` is allocated and not yet freed.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Ensure Proper Deallocation:**
   - To fix the memory leak, we need to ensure that `output` is freed before any early return that bypasses the normal deallocation path.

2. **Modify the Code:**
   - Add a call to `kfree(output)` before the early return at line 23 to ensure the allocated memory is properly deallocated.

### Step 3: Implement the Patch

1. **Original Code:**
   ```c
   if (pid < 0)
   {
       return;
   }
   ```

2. **Patched Code:**
   ```c
   if (pid < 0)
   {
       kfree(output);
       return;
   }
   ```

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that the allocated memory for `output` is freed before the function returns early, thus preventing the memory leak. Here is the complete reasoning for the patch:

- **Root Cause Analysis:**
  - The memory allocated to `output` is not freed if the function returns early due to `pid < 0`.

- **Fixing Strategy:**
  - Add a call to `kfree(output)` before the early return to ensure proper deallocation of memory.

- **Patch Implementation:**
  ```c
  <     {
  <         return;
  ---
  >     {
  >         kfree(output);
  >         return;
  ```

By following these steps, we ensure that the memory leak is fixed, and the function properly deallocates memory in all execution paths.
