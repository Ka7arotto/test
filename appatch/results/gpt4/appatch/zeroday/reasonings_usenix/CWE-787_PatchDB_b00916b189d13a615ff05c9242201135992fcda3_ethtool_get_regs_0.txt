To understand the reasoning behind the patch, let's break down the code and identify the root cause of the vulnerability, followed by the fixing strategy.

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Code Context:**
   - The function `ethtool_get_regs` is designed to retrieve Ethernet tool (ethtool) register data from a network device.
   - The function uses `kmalloc` to allocate memory for `regbuf` based on the length of the registers (`reglen`).

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is identified as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write.
   - The line in question is:
     ```c
     20     regbuf = kmalloc(reglen, GFP_USER);
     ```
   - `kmalloc` allocates a block of memory of size `reglen` but does not initialize it. This means the allocated memory contains arbitrary data.

3. **Potential Issues with Uninitialized Memory:**
   - If the allocated memory is not properly initialized, subsequent operations that assume the memory is zeroed out can lead to undefined behavior.
   - For example, if the memory is used to store data structures that expect zero-initialized fields, using uninitialized memory can lead to out-of-bounds writes or other forms of memory corruption.

4. **Ensuring Safe Memory Allocation:**
   - To prevent out-of-bounds writes and ensure the memory is in a known state, it is crucial to initialize the allocated memory.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Using `kzalloc` Instead of `kmalloc`:**
   - `kzalloc` is a kernel function that allocates memory and initializes it to zero.
   - By replacing `kmalloc` with `kzalloc`, we ensure that the allocated memory is zeroed out, preventing any undefined behavior due to uninitialized memory.

2. **Patch Implementation:**
   - The patch changes the memory allocation from `kmalloc` to `kzalloc`:
     ```c
     <     regbuf = kmalloc(reglen, GFP_USER);
     ---
     >     regbuf = kzalloc(reglen, GFP_USER);
     ```

### Conclusion

The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of uninitialized memory allocated by `kmalloc`, which can lead to out-of-bounds writes or other undefined behavior. The patch addresses this by using `kzalloc` to allocate and zero-initialize the memory, ensuring that the memory is in a known and safe state before use. This prevents potential out-of-bounds writes and enhances the overall safety and stability of the code.
