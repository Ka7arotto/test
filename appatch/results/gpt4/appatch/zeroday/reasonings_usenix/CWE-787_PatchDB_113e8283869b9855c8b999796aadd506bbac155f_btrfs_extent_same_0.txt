To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply a suitable fix. Here are the detailed reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Function and Parameters:**
   - The function `btrfs_extent_same` is designed to perform some operations on two inodes (`src` and `dst`) with specified offsets (`loff` and `dst_loff`) and a length (`len`).
   - The function `btrfs_double_lock` is called to lock the regions of the inodes for the specified length.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is identified as CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) at line 8.
   - The function `btrfs_double_lock` is called with the parameters `src`, `loff`, `dst`, `dst_loff`, and `len`.

3. **Analyzing the Parameters:**
   - The parameter `len` represents the length of the region to be locked.
   - If `len` is zero, it implies that there is no region to lock. However, calling `btrfs_double_lock` with a zero length might lead to undefined behavior or out-of-bounds access within the `btrfs_double_lock` function.

4. **Potential Vulnerability:**
   - If `len` is zero, the function `btrfs_double_lock` might not handle this case properly, leading to an out-of-bounds write or other undefined behavior.
   - Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that `len` is not zero before calling `btrfs_double_lock`.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Adding a Check for `len`:**
   - To prevent the vulnerability, we need to add a check to ensure that `len` is not zero before calling `btrfs_double_lock`.
   - If `len` is zero, the function should return early without calling `btrfs_double_lock`.

2. **Implementing the Fix:**
   - Add an `if` statement to check if `len` is zero.
   - If `len` is zero, return from the function early.
   - Otherwise, proceed to call `btrfs_double_lock`.

### Conclusion

The patch ensures that the function `btrfs_double_lock` is only called when `len` is non-zero, thereby preventing potential out-of-bounds write or undefined behavior.

### Patch Implementation

The patch modifies the code as follows:

```diff
<     }
<     btrfs_double_lock(src, loff, dst, dst_loff, len);
---
>     }
>     if (len == 0)
>     {
>         return 0;
>     }
>     btrfs_double_lock(src, loff, dst, dst_loff, len);
```

### Explanation of the Patch

- The original code calls `btrfs_double_lock` without checking if `len` is zero.
- The patched code adds a check for `len == 0`:
  - If `len` is zero, the function returns early with `return 0;`.
  - If `len` is non-zero, the function proceeds to call `btrfs_double_lock`.

This ensures that `btrfs_double_lock` is only called with a valid, non-zero length, thereby preventing the CWE-787 vulnerability.
