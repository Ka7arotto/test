To generate the patch for the given code slice, we need to follow a structured approach to identify the root cause of the vulnerability and then apply an appropriate fix. Here are the reasoning steps:

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Understanding the Function and Parameters:**
   - The function `bson_realloc` is designed to reallocate memory.
   - It takes two parameters: a pointer `ptr` to the memory to be reallocated and an integer `size` representing the new size of the memory block.

2. **Identifying the Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability in question is CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound.
   - Integer overflow can occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value that exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type.

3. **Analyzing the `size` Parameter:**
   - The `size` parameter is of type `int`.
   - The `int` type has a limited range (typically -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 for a 32-bit signed integer).
   - If `size` is a large positive value, it could potentially cause an integer overflow when used in memory allocation functions, leading to incorrect memory allocation and potential security issues.

4. **Potential Overflow Scenario:**
   - If `size` is close to the maximum value of an `int` and an additional operation (e.g., adding a header size) is performed, it could wrap around to a negative value or a smaller positive value.
   - This could result in allocating less memory than intended, leading to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.

### Step 2: Fixing Strategy

1. **Changing the Data Type:**
   - To prevent integer overflow, the `size` parameter should be changed to a data type that can handle larger values and is more appropriate for memory sizes.
   - The `size_t` type is an unsigned integer type specifically designed for representing sizes and counts. It is guaranteed to be able to represent the size of any object in memory.

2. **Applying the Patch:**
   - Change the type of the `size` parameter from `int` to `size_t`.
   - This change ensures that the `size` parameter can handle larger values without the risk of overflow.

### Conclusion

The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of an `int` type for the `size` parameter, which can lead to integer overflow. The fix involves changing the `size` parameter to `size_t`, which is more suitable for representing memory sizes and prevents overflow.

### Patch

```diff
< void *bson_realloc( void *ptr, int size ) {
---
> void *bson_realloc( void *ptr, size_t size ) {
```

By making this change, we ensure that the `size` parameter can handle larger values safely, thus mitigating the risk of integer overflow and the associated security vulnerabilities.
