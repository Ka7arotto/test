Certainly! Below are five possible code completions for the function `overlapping` that checks if two memory regions overlap. Each completion assumes that the function should return `TRUE` if there is an overlap and `FALSE` otherwise.

### Completion 1: Basic Overlap Check
```c
	if (pDstStart < pSrcEnd && pSrcStart < pDstEnd)
		return TRUE;
	return FALSE;
}
```
This completion checks if the start of one region is before the end of the other and vice versa, which indicates an overlap.

### Completion 2: Enhanced Check Including Edge Cases
```c
	if ((pDstStart <= pSrcEnd && pSrcStart < pDstEnd) || (pSrcStart <= pDstEnd && pDstStart < pSrcEnd))
		return TRUE;
	return FALSE;
}
```
This version includes checks up to and including the end pointers, which might be necessary depending on whether the end pointers are considered part of the regions.

### Completion 3: Check with Debug Information
```c
	if (pDstStart < pSrcEnd && pSrcStart < pDstEnd) {
		printf("Overlap detected: Dst[%p, %p], Src[%p, %p]\n", pDstStart, pDstEnd, pSrcStart, pSrcEnd);
		return TRUE;
	}
	return FALSE;
}
```
This completion adds debug output to the console when an overlap is detected, which can be helpful for debugging.

### Completion 4: Full Range Check
```c
	if ((pDstStart >= pSrcStart && pDstStart < pSrcEnd) || (pSrcStart >= pDstStart && pSrcStart < pDstEnd))
		return TRUE;
	if ((pDstEnd > pSrcStart && pDstEnd <= pSrcEnd) || (pSrcEnd > pDstStart && pSrcEnd <= pDstEnd))
		return TRUE;
	return FALSE;
}
```
This version checks both the start and end of each region against the start and end of the other region, providing a comprehensive overlap check.

### Completion 5: Using Memory Address Comparison
```c
	if ((pDstStart >= pSrcStart && pDstStart <= pSrcEnd) || (pSrcStart >= pDstStart && pSrcStart <= pDstEnd) ||
	    (pDstEnd >= pSrcStart && pDstEnd <= pSrcEnd) || (pSrcEnd >= pDstStart && pSrcEnd <= pDstEnd))
		return TRUE;
	return FALSE;
}
```
This completion uses a more inclusive comparison, considering the exact addresses of the start and end of each region, ensuring that even a single byte overlap is detected.

Each of these completions provides a different level of thoroughness and debugging assistance, allowing you to choose based on the specific needs of your application and development environment.
