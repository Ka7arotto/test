Certainly! Below are five possible code completions for the function `void thermal_debug_cdev_remove(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev)` that aim to address the CWE-476 vulnerability, which is related to NULL Pointer Dereferencing. Each completion ensures that the function safely handles cases where `cdev` might be NULL.

### Completion 1: Basic NULL Check
```c
void thermal_debug_cdev_remove(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev) {
    if (cdev == NULL) {
        printk(KERN_WARNING "Attempted to remove a NULL cooling device.\n");
        return;
    }
    // Proceed with removal
    printk(KERN_INFO "Removing cooling device: %s\n", cdev->type);
    // Assume further cleanup and removal logic here
}
```

### Completion 2: Enhanced Logging and Error Handling
```c
void thermal_debug_cdev_remove(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev) {
    if (!cdev) {
        printk(KERN_ERR "Error: NULL pointer received for cooling device removal.\n");
        return;
    }
    printk(KERN_INFO "Starting removal of cooling device: %s\n", cdev->type);
    // Additional checks and cleanup logic
    printk(KERN_INFO "Successfully removed cooling device: %s\n", cdev->type);
}
```

### Completion 3: Integration with System's Error Reporting
```c
void thermal_debug_cdev_remove(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev) {
    if (cdev == NULL) {
        printk(KERN_ALERT "Critical: NULL cooling device reference passed to removal function.\n");
        report_error(ERR_NULL_CDEV, "thermal_debug_cdev_remove");
        return;
    }
    printk(KERN_DEBUG "Processing removal of cooling device: %s\n", cdev->type);
    // Further removal logic
}
```

### Completion 4: Use in a Larger Context with Conditional Compilation
```c
void thermal_debug_cdev_remove(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev) {
    if (cdev == NULL) {
        printk(KERN_WARNING "NULL pointer detected in thermal_debug_cdev_remove.\n");
        return;
    }
    #ifdef CONFIG_THERMAL_DEBUG
    printk(KERN_DEBUG "Debug: Removing cooling device %s\n", cdev->type);
    #endif
    // Assume removal logic here
}
```

### Completion 5: Robust Error Handling with Function Return
```c
void thermal_debug_cdev_remove(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev) {
    if (cdev == NULL) {
        printk(KERN_ERROR "Failed to remove cooling device: Invalid NULL pointer.\n");
        return;
    }
    printk(KERN_INFO "Removing cooling device: %s\n", cdev->type);
    // Simulate some cleanup
    if (cleanup_cooling_device(cdev) != 0) {
        printk(KERN_ERROR "Failed to clean up cooling device: %s\n", cdev->type);
        return;
    }
    printk(KERN_INFO "Cooling device removed successfully.\n");
}
```

Each of these completions ensures that the function does not proceed with a NULL pointer, thus mitigating the risk of a NULL pointer dereference, and provides appropriate logging for debugging and error tracking.
