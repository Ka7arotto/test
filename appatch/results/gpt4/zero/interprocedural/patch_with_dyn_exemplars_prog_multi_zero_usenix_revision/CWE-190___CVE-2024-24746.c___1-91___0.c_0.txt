The CWE-190 vulnerability identified in the code at line 13 is related to an integer overflow. This can occur when `ticks_from_now` is added to the result of `ble_npl_time_get()`, potentially causing `abs_time` to wrap around if the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `ble_npl_time_t`. Here are five possible patches to address this vulnerability:

### Patch 1: Check for Overflow Before Addition
```c
13     ble_npl_time_t current_time = ble_npl_time_get();
14     if (ticks_from_now > BLE_NPL_TIME_MAX - current_time) {
15         // Handle overflow, e.g., by setting to max possible value or error handling
16         abs_time = BLE_NPL_TIME_MAX;
17     } else {
18         abs_time = current_time + ticks_from_now;
19     }
```
This patch checks if adding `ticks_from_now` to the current time would exceed the maximum value that `ble_npl_time_t` can hold. If it would, it sets `abs_time` to the maximum value.

### Patch 2: Use Safe Addition Function
If a safe addition function is available (or can be implemented), use it to prevent overflow:
```c
13     if (ble_npl_time_safe_add(&abs_time, ble_npl_time_get(), ticks_from_now) != 0) {
14         // Handle error (e.g., overflow occurred)
15         return;
16     }
```
This patch assumes the existence of a function `ble_npl_time_safe_add` that performs the addition safely and returns an error code if an overflow occurs.

### Patch 3: Limit `ticks_from_now` Based on Maximum Allowable Value
```c
13     ble_npl_time_t current_time = ble_npl_time_get();
14     if (ticks_from_now > BLE_NPL_TIME_MAX - current_time) {
15         ticks_from_now = BLE_NPL_TIME_MAX - current_time;
16     }
17     abs_time = current_time + ticks_from_now;
```
This patch adjusts `ticks_from_now` to the maximum allowable value that won't cause an overflow when added to the current time.

### Patch 4: Use Modular Arithmetic
```c
13     abs_time = (ble_npl_time_get() + ticks_from_now) % (BLE_NPL_TIME_MAX + 1);
```
This patch uses modular arithmetic to prevent overflow, ensuring that `abs_time` wraps around safely within the allowable range of `ble_npl_time_t`. Note that this approach changes the semantics and might not be suitable depending on the application logic.

### Patch 5: Assert or Error Check Before Addition
```c
13     ble_npl_time_t current_time = ble_npl_time_get();
14     BLE_HS_DBG_ASSERT(ticks_from_now <= BLE_NPL_TIME_MAX - current_time);
15     abs_time = current_time + ticks_from_now;
```
This patch adds an assertion (or could be changed to an error check with handling logic) that ensures `ticks_from_now` does not cause an overflow when added to the current time. This is a development-time check to catch logic errors early.

Each of these patches addresses the overflow issue in a slightly different way, and the best choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the system in which the code is used.
