Step 1: analyze the CWE-190 (Divide By Zero) vulnerability in the given code slice, let's reason about the behavior step-by-step:

1. Input analysis:
   - The code uses two variables: 'cc' and 'sp->bytes_per_line'
   - 'cc' is likely an integer representing some count or value
   - 'sp' is likely a pointer to a structure, and 'bytes_per_line' is a member of that structure

2. Operation:
   - The code performs a modulo operation: cc % sp->bytes_per_line

3. Vulnerability condition:
   - CWE-190 is a Divide By Zero vulnerability
   - In modulo operations, a divide by zero occurs when the divisor is zero

4. Potential vulnerability:
   - If sp->bytes_per_line is zero, the modulo operation will cause a divide by zero error
   - This can lead to a crash or undefined behavior in the program

5. Missing check:
   - The code doesn't verify that sp->bytes_per_line is non-zero before the modulo operation
   - This omission is the root cause of the potential divide by zero vulnerability

Conclusion:
The vulnerability arises because the code doesn't ensure that sp->bytes_per_line is non-zero before performing the modulo operation. If sp->bytes_per_line is zero, it will result in a divide by zero error, potentially causing a crash or undefined behavior. To fix this, a check should be added to ensure sp->bytes_per_line is not zero before performing the modulo operation.
Step 2. Based on the analysis, here are five possible patches for the vulnerability:

Patch 1: Add a check for zero before the modulo operation
```
- if (cc%sp->bytes_per_line!=0)
+ if (sp->bytes_per_line != 0 && cc%sp->bytes_per_line!=0)
```

Patch 2: Use a separate if statement to check for zero
```
- if (cc%sp->bytes_per_line!=0)
+ if (sp->bytes_per_line == 0) return ERROR_CODE;
+ if (cc%sp->bytes_per_line!=0)
```

Patch 3: Use a ternary operator to handle the zero case
```
- if (cc%sp->bytes_per_line!=0)
+ if ((sp->bytes_per_line == 0) ? true : (cc%sp->bytes_per_line!=0))
```

Patch 4: Use a macro to check for zero
```
+ #define SAFE_MOD(a,b) ((b) == 0 ? 0 : ((a)%(b)))
- if (cc%sp->bytes_per_line!=0)
+ if (SAFE_MOD(cc, sp->bytes_per_line)!=0)
```

Patch 5: Use a helper function to perform safe modulo
```
+ static int safe_mod(int a, int b) {
+     return (b == 0) ? 0 : (a % b);
+ }
- if (cc%sp->bytes_per_line!=0)
+ if (safe_mod(cc, sp->bytes_per_line)!=0)
```

These patches all address the divide-by-zero vulnerability by ensuring that sp->bytes_per_line is not zero before performing the modulo operation. The choice between these patches would depend on the specific coding standards and practices of the project.
