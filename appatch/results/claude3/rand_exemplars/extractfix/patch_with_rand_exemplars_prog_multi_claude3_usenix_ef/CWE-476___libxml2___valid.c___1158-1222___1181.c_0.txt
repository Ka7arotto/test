Step 1: 's analyze the code step by step to understand the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability:

1. Input analysis:
   - The function takes three parameters: buf, content, and glob.
   - We're particularly interested in the 'content' parameter, which is of type xmlElementContentPtr.

2. Initial check (line 3):
   - There's a null check for 'content': if (content == NULL) return;
   - This check prevents a null pointer dereference on 'content' itself.

3. Switch statement (line 6):
   - The code enters a switch statement based on content->type.
   - This access to content->type is safe due to the earlier null check.

4. Vulnerable line (line 18):
   - The code attempts to access content->c1->type.
   - While 'content' is checked for NULL, there's no check for content->c1 being NULL.

5. Potential vulnerability:
   - If content->c1 is NULL, attempting to access content->c1->type will result in a null pointer dereference.
   - This can lead to a program crash or undefined behavior.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because the code assumes that content->c1 is not NULL without explicitly checking. If content->c1 is NULL, accessing content->c1->type will cause a null pointer dereference, leading to the CWE-476 vulnerability. To fix this, an additional null check for content->c1 should be added before accessing its members.
Step 2. Based on this analysis, here are five possible patches to address the vulnerability:

Patch 1: Add a null check before accessing content->c1
```
<     if ((content->c1->type == XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_OR) ||
---
>     if (content->c1 != NULL && (content->c1->type == XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_OR) ||
```

Patch 2: Use a separate if statement to check for NULL
```
<     if ((content->c1->type == XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_OR) ||
---
>     if (content->c1 == NULL) return;
>     if ((content->c1->type == XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_OR) ||
```

Patch 3: Use a ternary operator to provide a default value
```
<     if ((content->c1->type == XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_OR) ||
---
>     if (((content->c1 ? content->c1->type : 0) == XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_OR) ||
```

Patch 4: Introduce a temporary variable with null check
```
<     if ((content->c1->type == XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_OR) ||
---
>     xmlElementContentPtr c1 = content->c1;
>     if (c1 != NULL && (c1->type == XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_OR) ||
```

Patch 5: Use a macro for null-safe access
```
<     if ((content->c1->type == XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_OR) ||
---
>     #define SAFE_ACCESS(ptr, member) ((ptr) ? (ptr)->member : 0)
>     if ((SAFE_ACCESS(content->c1, type) == XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_OR) ||
```

Each of these patches addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that content->c1 is not NULL before attempting to access its type member, thus preventing the potential null pointer dereference.
