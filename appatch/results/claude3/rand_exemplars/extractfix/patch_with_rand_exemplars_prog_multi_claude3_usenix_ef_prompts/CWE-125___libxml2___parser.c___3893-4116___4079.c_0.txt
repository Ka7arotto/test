```
1 s32 vvc_parse_picture_header(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, VVCSliceInfo *si)
3 	u32 pps_id;
5 	si->irap_or_gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "irap_or_gdr_pic");
6 	si->non_ref_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "non_ref_pic");
7 	if (si->irap_or_gdr_pic)
8 		si->gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "gdr_pic");
9 	if ((si->inter_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "inter_slice_allowed_flag")))
10 		si->intra_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "intra_slice_allowed_flag");
12 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
13 	if (pps_id >= 64)
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `pps_id` using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id")`.
   - This function likely returns an unsigned integer (u32).

2. Bounds Checking:
   - The code checks if `pps_id >= 64`, but doesn't check for a lower bound.
   - The array access `vvc->pps[pps_id]` assumes `pps_id` is non-negative.

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `pps_id` is negative, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `vvc->pps[pps_id]`.
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because the code doesn't check for negative values of `pps_id`. Although `pps_id` is likely unsigned, it's safer to explicitly check for negative values to prevent potential issues if the type changes or if there's unexpected behavior in `gf_bs_read_ue_log()`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To fix this vulnerability, we need to add a check for negative values of `pps_id`. The existing check for the upper bound (64) is correct, so we'll keep that and add the lower bound check.

The patch should:
1. Check if `pps_id` is negative
2. Maintain the existing check for `pps_id >= 64`

Therefore, the patch becomes:

```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

This patch ensures that `pps_id` is within the valid range (0 to 63) before accessing `vvc->pps[pps_id]`, preventing both negative index access and out-of-bounds access for values 64 and above.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int serdes_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
4 	struct serdes_ctrl *ctrl;
5 	unsigned int i;
6 	int ret;
8 	ctrl = devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*ctrl), GFP_KERNEL);
9 	if (!ctrl)
12 	ctrl->dev = &pdev->dev;
13 	ctrl->regs = syscon_node_to_regmap(pdev->dev.parent->of_node);
14 	if (IS_ERR(ctrl->regs))
17 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
18 		ret = serdes_phy_create(ctrl, i, &ctrl->phys[i]);
19 		if (ret)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		ret = serdes_phy_create(ctrl, i, &ctrl->phys[i]);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
I'll provide the reasoning steps for generating this patch following the two-step process:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Array Bounds:
   - The code iterates over an array `ctrl->phys` using index `i`.
   - The loop condition is `i <= SERDES_MAX`, which means it will iterate SERDES_MAX + 1 times.

2. Array Access:
   - Inside the loop, `ctrl->phys[i]` is accessed.
   - This suggests that `ctrl->phys` is an array with SERDES_MAX + 1 elements.

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `ctrl->phys` is actually defined with SERDES_MAX elements (indexed 0 to SERDES_MAX - 1), then the last iteration (when i == SERDES_MAX) would access an out-of-bounds element.
   - This is a classic off-by-one error, where the loop iterates one time too many.

4. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read):
   - The vulnerability is classified as CWE-125, which indicates that the code is attempting to read outside the bounds of the allocated memory.
   - This confirms our analysis that the array access is likely out-of-bounds.

Conclusion:
The vulnerable behavior is caused by the loop iterating one time too many, potentially accessing an array element that doesn't exist. This can lead to reading unintended memory, causing undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the loop doesn't access the array out of bounds. The simplest way to do this is to change the loop condition from `i <= SERDES_MAX` to `i < SERDES_MAX`. This ensures that:

1. The loop iterates exactly SERDES_MAX times.
2. The highest value of `i` will be SERDES_MAX - 1, which is the last valid index if `ctrl->phys` has SERDES_MAX elements.

Therefore, the patch should be:

```
< 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
---
> 	for (i = 0; i < SERDES_MAX; i++) {
```

This patch changes the loop to iterate from 0 to SERDES_MAX - 1, ensuring that all accesses to `ctrl->phys[i]` are within the bounds of the array, thus fixing the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int drxj_dap_atomic_read_reg32(struct i2c_device_addr *dev_addr, u32 addr, u32 *data, u32 flags)
3     u8 buf[sizeof(*data)];
6     if (!data)
11     word = (u32)buf[3];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
11     word = (u32)buf[3];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
I'll provide the reasoning steps for generating this patch following the two-step process:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input validation:
   - The function takes a pointer 'data' as input, which is checked for NULL.
   - However, there's no check on the return value of 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block'.

2. Buffer usage:
   - A buffer 'buf' is declared with size 'sizeof(*data)'.
   - 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block' is called to fill this buffer.
   - The code then directly accesses 'buf[3]' without checking if the read operation was successful.

3. Potential vulnerability:
   - If 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block' fails (returns a negative value), 'buf' might not be properly initialized.
   - Accessing 'buf[3]' in this case could lead to reading uninitialized or out-of-bounds memory.
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because the code doesn't check the return value of 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block' before accessing 'buf'. If this function fails, accessing 'buf[3]' could lead to undefined behavior or information disclosure.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To fix this vulnerability, we need to:
1. Check the return value of 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block'.
2. Only proceed with accessing 'buf' if the read operation was successful.

The patch implements this strategy by:
1. Adding a check for the return value 'rc' after calling 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block'.
2. If 'rc' is negative (indicating an error), the function returns early with a value of 0.
3. Only if the read operation succeeds does the code proceed to access 'buf[3]'.

This patch ensures that 'buf' is only accessed when it has been properly initialized, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
5 	s32 vps_id;
6 	HEVC_VPS *vps;
10 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
12 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
I'll provide the reasoning steps for generating this patch following the two-step process:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input validation:
   - The code reads `vps_id` from a bitstream using `gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id")`.
   - This function reads 4 bits, which can represent values from 0 to 15 (2^4 - 1).

2. Existing check:
   - The code checks if `vps_id >= 16`, returning -1 if true.
   - This check prevents accessing array indices 16 and above.

3. Potential vulnerability:
   - The existing check doesn't account for negative values of `vps_id`.
   - If `vps_id` is negative, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]`.
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because the code doesn't check for negative values of `vps_id`. A negative `vps_id` could cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `hevc->vps` array.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range for array indexing (0 to 15). This can be achieved by adding a check for negative values in addition to the existing upper bound check.

The patch should:
1. Check if `vps_id` is less than 0
2. Maintain the existing check for `vps_id >= 16`
3. Return -1 if either condition is true

Therefore, the appropriate patch is:

```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range of 0 to 15, preventing both negative index accesses and accesses beyond the array bounds.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int wm8994_get_drc_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input validation:
   - The function `wm8994_get_drc()` returns an integer `drc`.
   - There's no check on the value of `drc` before using it as an array index.

2. Array access:
   - `drc` is used as an index to access `wm8994->drc_cfg[drc]`.
   - If `drc` is negative or exceeds the array bounds, it would lead to out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).

3. Potential vulnerability:
   - If `wm8994_get_drc()` returns a negative value, it could cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing `wm8994->drc_cfg[drc]`.
   - This could lead to reading unintended memory, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing a crash.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because there's no validation of the `drc` value before using it as an array index. A negative value could lead to an out-of-bounds read.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Add a check for negative `drc` values:
   - Before using `drc` as an array index, verify that it's not negative.
   - If `drc` is negative, return the error value instead of proceeding.

2. Implement the fix:
   - Add an if statement to check if `drc` is negative.
   - If negative, return the `drc` value (assuming it's an error code).
   - Only proceed with the array access if `drc` is non-negative.

3. Resulting patch:
```
>     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (drc < 0)
>     {
>         return drc;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```

This patch adds the necessary check to prevent out-of-bounds read when `drc` is negative, addressing the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int crypto_report_akcipher(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3 	struct crypto_report_akcipher rakcipher;
5 	strlcpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
5 	strlcpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Function Usage:
   - The code uses `strlcpy()`, which is a non-standard function designed to be a safer alternative to `strcpy()`.
   - `strlcpy()` is meant to guarantee null-termination of the destination string.

2. Potential Issues:
   - While `strlcpy()` is generally safer than `strcpy()`, it's not part of the standard C library and may not be available on all systems.
   - If `strlcpy()` is not implemented correctly, it could lead to buffer overflows or other undefined behavior.

3. Buffer Size:
   - The destination buffer size is specified as `sizeof(rakcipher.type)`.
   - This correctly limits the copy operation to the size of the destination buffer.

4. Source String:
   - The source string "akcipher" is a constant string literal.
   - Its length (including null terminator) is 9 bytes.

5. Vulnerability Classification:
   - The vulnerability is classified as CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read).
   - This suggests that the issue is related to reading beyond the bounds of a buffer, rather than writing.

6. Conclusion:
   - The use of `strlcpy()` itself is not inherently problematic if implemented correctly.
   - The vulnerability might be due to how `strlcpy()` is implemented or used in this specific context.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Standard Function:
   - Replace `strlcpy()` with the standard C library function `strncpy()`.
   - `strncpy()` is widely available and has well-defined behavior.

2. Buffer Protection:
   - `strncpy()` will copy at most `n` characters, where `n` is the third argument.
   - Using `sizeof(rakcipher.type)` as the third argument ensures we don't write beyond the buffer.

3. Null Termination:
   - Unlike `strlcpy()`, `strncpy()` doesn't guarantee null-termination if the source string is longer than the destination buffer.
   - However, in this case, "akcipher" (9 bytes including null terminator) is likely shorter than `rakcipher.type`, so null-termination should be preserved.

4. Addressing CWE-125:
   - While the patch doesn't directly address an out-of-bounds read, using a standard function reduces the risk of implementation-specific vulnerabilities.

5. Resulting Patch:
```
< 	strlcpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));
---
> 	strncpy(rakcipher.type, "akcipher", sizeof(rakcipher.type));
```

This patch replaces the non-standard `strlcpy()` with the standard `strncpy()`, maintaining the same buffer size limit. It addresses potential implementation-specific issues with `strlcpy()` while still providing protection against buffer overflows.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 decrypt_response(struct sc_card *card, unsigned char *in, size_t inlen, unsigned char *out, size_t * out_len)
3 	size_t cipher_len;
4 	size_t i;

9 	if (!card->drv_data) 
15 	if (in[0] == 0x99)
19 	if (0x01 == in[2] && 0x82 != in[1]) {

21 		i = 3;
23 	else if (0x01 == in[3] && 0x81 == in[1]) {
24 		cipher_len = in[2];
25 		i = 4;
27 	else if (0x01 == in[4] && 0x82 == in[1]) {
28 		cipher_len = in[2] * 0x100;
29 		cipher_len += in[3];
30 		i = 5;
36 	if (cipher_len < 2 || i+cipher_len > inlen || cipher_len > sizeof plaintext)
46 	while (0x80 != plaintext[cipher_len - 2] && (cipher_len - 2 > 0))
47 		cipher_len--;
49 	if (2 == cipher_len)
53 	*out_len = cipher_len - 2;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
53 	*out_len = cipher_len - 2;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The function takes input parameters 'in', 'inlen', 'out', and 'out_len'.
   - 'cipher_len' is derived from the input 'in' based on different conditions.

2. Buffer Size:
   - A fixed-size buffer 'plaintext' is declared with 4096 bytes.
   - There's a check to ensure 'cipher_len' doesn't exceed the size of 'plaintext'.

3. Cipher Length Adjustment:
   - The 'cipher_len' is potentially reduced in a while loop (line 46-47).
   - This reduction could make 'cipher_len' as small as 2.

4. Vulnerability:
   - At line 53, '*out_len = cipher_len - 2' is executed without checking if 'cipher_len' is greater than 2.
   - If 'cipher_len' is 2, this subtraction would result in 0, which is correct but not sufficient.
   - If 'cipher_len' became less than 2 due to the while loop, this would cause an integer underflow, leading to a very large value for '*out_len'.

5. Output Buffer:
   - The function doesn't explicitly check if the 'out' buffer is large enough to hold 'cipher_len - 2' bytes.

Conclusion: The vulnerability occurs because there's no check to ensure that 'cipher_len' is greater than 2 before the subtraction, and there's no verification that the 'out' buffer is large enough for the result.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To address this vulnerability, we need to:
1. Ensure that 'cipher_len' is greater than 2 before performing the subtraction.
2. Verify that the 'out' buffer is large enough to hold the result.

The proposed patch adds a condition to check if '*out_len' is less than 'cipher_len - 2':

```
< 	if (2 == cipher_len)
---
> 	if (2 == cipher_len || *out_len < cipher_len - 2)
```

This patch achieves both goals:
1. If 'cipher_len' is 2, the original condition is met, preventing the subtraction.
2. If '*out_len' (which represents the size of the 'out' buffer) is less than 'cipher_len - 2', it prevents writing beyond the buffer's capacity.

This fix ensures that the subtraction only occurs when it's safe to do so and when the result can fit in the output buffer, effectively addressing the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 s32 vvc_parse_picture_header(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, VVCSliceInfo *si)

8 		si->gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "gdr_pic");
9 	if ((si->inter_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "inter_slice_allowed_flag")))
10 		si->intra_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "intra_slice_allowed_flag");
12 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
13 	if (pps_id >= 64)
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `pps_id` using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id")`.
   - This function likely returns an unsigned integer (u32).

2. Bounds Checking:
   - The code checks if `pps_id >= 64`, but doesn't check for a lower bound.
   - The array access `vvc->pps[pps_id]` assumes `pps_id` is non-negative.

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `pps_id` is negative, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `vvc->pps[pps_id]`.
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because the code only checks the upper bound of `pps_id` but not the lower bound. If `pps_id` is negative, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps_id` is within the valid range for array indexing. This means checking both the lower and upper bounds.

1. Add a check for the lower bound:
   - Ensure `pps_id` is non-negative.

2. Combine with existing upper bound check:
   - Keep the existing check for `pps_id >= 64`.

3. Implement the fix:
   - Modify the condition to check both bounds in a single if statement.

Therefore, the patch should be:

```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

This patch ensures that `pps_id` is both non-negative and less than 64, preventing out-of-bounds access to the `vvc->pps` array.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_pps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc)
4 	s32 pps_id;
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
8 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
10 	if ((pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64)) {
14 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
16 	if (!pps->state) {
17 		pps->id = pps_id;
18 		pps->state = 1;
20 	pps->sps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "sps_id");
21 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
21 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
I'll provide the reasoning steps for generating this patch following the two-step process:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `pps_id` using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id")`.
   - It checks if `pps_id` is within the range [0, 63].

2. Array Access:
   - `pps` is assigned using `hevc->pps[pps_id]`, which is safe due to the previous check.

3. SPS ID Reading:
   - `pps->sps_id` is read using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "sps_id")`.
   - The code checks if `pps->sps_id >= 16`.

4. Potential Vulnerability:
   - The check `pps->sps_id >= 16` only guards against values that are too high.
   - It doesn't protect against negative values, which could lead to out-of-bounds access.
   - `gf_bs_read_ue_log` likely returns a signed 32-bit integer (s32), so negative values are possible.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability arises because the code doesn't check for negative values of `pps->sps_id`. If `pps->sps_id` is negative, it could lead to out-of-bounds array access when used as an index elsewhere in the code.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To address this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps->sps_id` is within the valid range [0, 15]. This can be achieved by modifying the condition to check for both lower and upper bounds:

```
< 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
---
> 	if ((pps->sps_id < 0) || (pps->sps_id >= 16)) {
```

This patch:
1. Adds a check for negative values: `pps->sps_id < 0`
2. Maintains the existing upper bound check: `pps->sps_id >= 16`
3. Combines both conditions using the OR operator `||`

This ensures that `pps->sps_id` is within the valid range [0, 15], preventing potential out-of-bounds access and addressing the CWE-125 vulnerability.
