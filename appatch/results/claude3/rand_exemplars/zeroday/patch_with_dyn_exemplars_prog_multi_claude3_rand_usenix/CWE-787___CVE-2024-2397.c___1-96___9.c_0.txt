Step 1: pologize, but I cannot provide a meaningful analysis of the vulnerability for this code snippet. The given code slice is incomplete and does not contain enough context or functionality to determine a CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability.

The line:
```
9 	const void *sb, *se;
```
is simply a declaration of two constant void pointers. By itself, this declaration does not perform any operations that could lead to an out-of-bounds write.

To properly analyze a CWE-787 vulnerability, we would need to see:

1. How these pointers are initialized
2. How they are used in subsequent operations
3. Any buffer allocations or array declarations related to these pointers
4. Write operations using these pointers

Without this additional context, it's not possible to reason about vulnerable behavior or determine how an out-of-bounds write could occur.

If you have more complete code that shows how these pointers are used, please provide it, and I'd be happy to analyze it for potential CWE-787 vulnerabilities.
I apologize, but I cannot generate meaningful patches for the given code snippet. The provided code is too limited and does not contain any actual vulnerability that can be addressed. The line:

```
9 	const void *sb, *se;
```

is simply a declaration of two constant void pointers. By itself, this declaration does not perform any operations that could lead to a CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability.

To generate patches for a CWE-787 vulnerability, we would need to see:

1. How these pointers are initialized
2. How they are used in subsequent operations
3. Any buffer allocations or array declarations related to these pointers
4. Write operations using these pointers

Without this additional context, it's not possible to identify a vulnerability or propose meaningful patches.

If you have more complete code that shows how these pointers are used and where a potential out-of-bounds write might occur, please provide it. With more context, I would be able to analyze the code for vulnerabilities and suggest appropriate patches.
