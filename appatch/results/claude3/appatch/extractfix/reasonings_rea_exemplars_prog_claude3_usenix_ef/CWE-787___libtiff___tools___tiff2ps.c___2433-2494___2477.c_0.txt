Let's analyze the code step by step to understand the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability:

1. Input parameters:
   - The function takes parameters including file descriptor (fd), TIFF image (tif), width (w), height (h), and number of components (nc).

2. Buffer allocation:
   - A buffer 'tf_buf' is allocated with size 'tf_bytesperrow' (line 11).

3. Main loop:
   - The function loops through each row of the image (line 16).

4. Pointer initialization:
   - 'cp' is initialized to point to the start of 'tf_buf' (line 19).

5. Inner loop:
   - An inner loop processes each pixel in the row (line 49).

6. Pixel processing:
   - The switch statement (lines 51-56) processes 'nc' number of components for each pixel.

7. Vulnerability point:
   - After processing each pixel, 'cp' is incremented by 'es' (line 57).
   - 'es' is calculated as 'samplesperpixel - nc' (line 6).

8. Potential overflow:
   - If 'samplesperpixel' is less than or equal to 'nc', 'es' will be zero or negative.
   - This can cause 'cp' to either not move or move backwards, leading to processing the same data repeatedly.
   - Over multiple iterations, 'cp' may eventually point beyond the allocated buffer.

9. Out-of-bounds write:
   - When 'cp' points beyond 'tf_buf', the writes in the switch statement (lines 52-55) will cause out-of-bounds writes.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because there's no bounds checking on 'cp'. If 'es' is zero or negative, 'cp' may eventually point outside the allocated buffer, leading to out-of-bounds writes. This can corrupt memory, cause crashes, or potentially be exploited for malicious purposes. To fix this, proper bounds checking should be implemented, and the relationship between 'samplesperpixel' and 'nc' should be validated to ensure 'es' is always positive.
