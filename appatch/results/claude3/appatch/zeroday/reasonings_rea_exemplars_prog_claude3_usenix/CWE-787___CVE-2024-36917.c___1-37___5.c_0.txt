For this code slice, there isn't enough information to determine a CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability directly. The line you've indicated:

```
5 	uint64_t start, len;
```

is simply a variable declaration. It doesn't perform any operations that could lead to an out-of-bounds write. To have a CWE-787 vulnerability, we would need to see how these variables are used, particularly in writing to memory.

Without more context or code showing how `start` and `len` are used, it's not possible to reason about a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The vulnerability would typically occur when these variables are used to access or modify memory locations beyond the intended bounds of an array or buffer.

If you have additional code that shows how these variables are used, particularly in memory operations, I'd be happy to analyze that for potential vulnerabilities.
