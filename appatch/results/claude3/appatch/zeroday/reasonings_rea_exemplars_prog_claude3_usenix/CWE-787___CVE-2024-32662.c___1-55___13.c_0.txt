Let's analyze the code step by step to identify the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability:

1. Input handling:
   - The function takes a stream 's' and a pointer to length 'pLength' as input.
   - It calls 'rdp_redirection_get_data' to extract data from the stream.

2. Data extraction:
   - Line 8: 'rdp_redirection_get_data' populates 'ptr' with the extracted data.
   - Line 10: 'wchar' is set to point to the same data as 'ptr', casting it to WCHAR*.

3. Conversion attempt:
   - Line 13: 'ConvertWCharNToUtf8Alloc' is called to convert WCHAR to UTF-8.
   - It uses 'wchar' as the source and '*pLength' as the number of characters to convert.

4. Potential vulnerability:
   - The vulnerability lies in trusting '*pLength' without validation.
   - If '*pLength' is larger than the actual allocated size of 'wchar', it could lead to reading beyond the buffer's bounds.

5. Out-of-bounds write:
   - 'ConvertWCharNToUtf8Alloc' may write beyond the allocated memory for 'utf8' if '*pLength' is too large.
   - This can cause buffer overflow, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

Conclusion:
The CWE-787 vulnerability occurs because the code doesn't validate '*pLength' before using it in the conversion function. If '*pLength' is manipulated to be larger than the actual size of the 'wchar' buffer, it can cause an out-of-bounds write when allocating and writing to 'utf8'. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or potential security exploits. To fix this, the code should validate '*pLength' against the actual size of the allocated 'wchar' buffer before passing it to 'ConvertWCharNToUtf8Alloc'.
