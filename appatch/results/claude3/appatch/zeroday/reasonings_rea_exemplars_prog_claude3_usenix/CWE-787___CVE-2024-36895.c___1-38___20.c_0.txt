Let's analyze the code step by step to identify the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability:

1. Input analysis:
   - The function takes parameters: page (char*), len (size_t), fun (function pointer), priv (void*), and size (unsigned int).
   - 'page' is a pointer to a character array, and 'len' is its length.

2. Buffer allocation:
   - Line 6: bufsize is calculated as 1 + size * 8 + 1 + 1
   - Line 14: buf is allocated using kzalloc with bufsize

3. Main loop (line 18-31):
   - Iterates while pg - page < len

4. Inner loop (line 20-22):
   - Condition: i < sizeof(buf) && (pg - page < len)
   - Action: buf[i++] = *pg++

5. Vulnerability analysis:
   - The vulnerability occurs in the inner loop condition (line 20)
   - sizeof(buf) is used instead of bufsize
   - sizeof(buf) returns the size of the pointer (typically 4 or 8 bytes), not the allocated size

6. Consequences:
   - The loop can write beyond the allocated buffer size
   - It will continue writing until i reaches sizeof(buf) or pg - page reaches len
   - This can lead to buffer overflow, writing into adjacent memory

Conclusion:
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) caused by using sizeof(buf) instead of the actual allocated size (bufsize) in the loop condition. This allows the loop to write beyond the allocated buffer, potentially corrupting adjacent memory or causing other undefined behavior. To fix this, replace sizeof(buf) with bufsize in the loop condition.
