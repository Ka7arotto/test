To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `vps_id` from a bitstream using `gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id")`.
   - This function reads 4 bits, which can represent values from 0 to 15.

2. Existing Check:
   - There's a check `if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;` to ensure `vps_id` is not too large.

3. Array Access:
   - The code accesses `vvc->vps[vps_id]` without checking if `vps_id` is negative.

4. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `vps_id` is negative, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `vvc->vps[vps_id]`.
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

5. Missing Check:
   - The code lacks a check for negative values of `vps_id`.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability arises because the code doesn't check for negative values of `vps_id` before using it as an array index. While `gf_bs_read_int_log` likely returns an unsigned value, the `vps_id` is declared as `s32` (signed 32-bit integer), allowing for potential negative values.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To address this vulnerability, we need to add a check for negative values of `vps_id`. The existing check for values >= 16 is correct, but we should extend it to include negative values as well.

The patch should:
1. Check if `vps_id` is negative.
2. Combine this check with the existing check for values >= 16.
3. Return an error code if either condition is true.

Therefore, the appropriate patch is:

```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range (0 to 15) before it's used as an array index, preventing both negative index access and out-of-bounds access for values 16 and above.
