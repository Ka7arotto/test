To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Identify the data structures:
   - `chan` is a `struct nerd_channel` containing a linked list of subscriptions.
   - Each node in the list is an `objectlist` structure.
   - Each `objectlist` node contains a pointer to a `struct subscription`.

2. Analyze the memory management:
   - The code iterates through the linked list of subscriptions.
   - When a matching subscription is found (line 13), it's removed from the list.
   - The `objectlist` node is freed (line 16), but the `subscription` object it points to is not.

3. Identify the vulnerability:
   - The `subscription` object (`subscr`) is allocated but never freed.
   - This results in a memory leak (CWE-401) each time a subscription is cancelled.
   - Over time, this can lead to significant memory consumption if many subscriptions are cancelled.

Conclusion: The root cause is incomplete deallocation of dynamically allocated memory. While the list node is freed, the subscription object it points to is not, causing a memory leak.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Determine the correct deallocation procedure:
   - Both the `objectlist` node and the `subscription` object it points to should be freed.
   - The `objectlist` node is already being freed (line 16).
   - We need to add code to free the `subscription` object as well.

2. Identify the correct location for the fix:
   - The `subscription` object should be freed immediately after the `objectlist` node.
   - This ensures that all associated memory is released when a subscription is cancelled.

3. Implement the fix:
   - Add a line to free the `subscr` pointer after freeing the `list` pointer.
   - The new code should be:
     ```c
     free(list);
     free(subscr);
     ```

4. Verify the fix:
   - Ensure that the added line doesn't introduce new issues (e.g., double frees).
   - Confirm that it's placed correctly in the logic flow.

Therefore, the patch should be:

```diff
<             free(list);
<             if (prev)
---
>             free(list);
>             free(subscr);
>             if (prev)
```

This patch addresses the memory leak by ensuring that both the list node and the subscription object are properly deallocated when a subscription is cancelled.
