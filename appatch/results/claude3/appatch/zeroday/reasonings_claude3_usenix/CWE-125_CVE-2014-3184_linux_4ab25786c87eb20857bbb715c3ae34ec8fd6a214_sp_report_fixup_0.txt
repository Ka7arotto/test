To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The function takes a pointer `rdesc` and a size `*rsize`.
   - The code checks if `*rsize >= 107` before accessing elements of `rdesc`.

2. Array Access:
   - The code accesses `rdesc` at indices 104, 105, 106, 110, and 111.
   - The highest index accessed is 111.

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - The check `*rsize >= 107` only ensures that indices up to 106 are safe to access.
   - However, the code accesses `rdesc[110]` and `rdesc[111]`, which are beyond the checked size.
   - This can lead to out-of-bounds read/write if `*rsize` is between 107 and 111.

4. Vulnerability Classification:
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability because it may read beyond the allocated buffer.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Correct Bound Checking:
   - To safely access `rdesc[111]`, we need to ensure that `*rsize` is at least 112 (since array indices start at 0).
   - The fix should change the size check from 107 to 112.

2. Minimal Change:
   - The simplest fix is to update the condition in the if statement.
   - Change `*rsize >= 107` to `*rsize >= 112`.

3. Resulting Patch:
```
< 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
---
> 	if (*rsize >= 112 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
```

This patch ensures that all accessed elements of `rdesc` are within bounds, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
