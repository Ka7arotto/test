To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Identify the vulnerability:
   - The code has a CWE-401 vulnerability, which is "Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime."
   - This occurs at line 76: `pool->nonce1 = strdup(json_string_value(json_array_get(res_val, 1)));`

2. Analyze the problematic behavior:
   - The `strdup` function allocates memory for a new string.
   - This new string is assigned to `pool->nonce1`.
   - If `pool->nonce1` already contains a previously allocated string, that memory is not freed before the new assignment.

3. Potential consequences:
   - This can lead to a memory leak if the function is called multiple times or in a loop.
   - Over time, these leaks can accumulate, potentially exhausting the system's memory resources.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Identify the fix:
   - To resolve this issue, we need to free any existing memory allocated to `pool->nonce1` before assigning new memory to it.

2. Implement the fix:
   - Add a `free(pool->nonce1);` statement before the `strdup` assignment.
   - This ensures that any previously allocated memory is properly released before a new allocation.

3. Resulting patch:
```
<     }
<     pool->nonce1 = strdup(json_string_value(json_array_get(res_val, 1)));
---
>     }
>     free(pool->nonce1);
>     pool->nonce1 = strdup(json_string_value(json_array_get(res_val, 1)));
```

4. Verify the fix:
   - This patch addresses the memory leak by freeing the existing memory before allocating new memory.
   - It's important to note that `free(NULL)` is a safe operation in C, so this fix works even if `pool->nonce1` is initially NULL.

By following these steps, we can generate a patch that effectively addresses the CWE-401 vulnerability in the given code.
