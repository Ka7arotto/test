To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input validation:
   - The function takes a pointer `rdesc` and a size `*rsize`.
   - There's a condition checking if `*rsize >= 74`.

2. Array access:
   - The code accesses `rdesc` at indices 62, 64, 66, 72, and 74.
   - The highest index accessed is 74.

3. Potential vulnerability:
   - CWE-125 is "Out-of-bounds Read", but this case involves a write operation.
   - The vulnerability occurs because the code writes to `rdesc[74]` when `*rsize` could be exactly 74.
   - Array indices in C start at 0, so an array of size 74 has valid indices 0 to 73.

4. Conclusion:
   - The root cause is insufficient bounds checking. The condition `*rsize >= 74` allows access to index 74, which is out of bounds for an array of size 74.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. To ensure safe access to index 74, we need to guarantee that `*rsize` is at least 75.
2. This can be achieved by modifying the condition from `*rsize >= 74` to `*rsize >= 75`.
3. This change ensures that there are at least 75 elements in the array, making it safe to access index 74.

Therefore, the appropriate patch is:

```
< 		if (*rsize >= 74 &&
---
> 		if (*rsize >= 75 &&
```

This patch increases the minimum required size by 1, preventing out-of-bounds access when writing to `rdesc[74]`.
