To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `pps_id` using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id")`.
   - This function likely returns an unsigned integer (u32).

2. Bounds Checking:
   - The code checks if `pps_id >= 64`, but doesn't check for a lower bound.
   - The array access `vvc->pps[pps_id]` assumes `pps_id` is non-negative.

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `pps_id` is negative, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `vvc->pps[pps_id]`.
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because the code doesn't check for negative values of `pps_id`. Although `pps_id` is likely unsigned, it's safer to explicitly check for negative values to prevent potential issues if the type changes or if there's unexpected behavior in `gf_bs_read_ue_log()`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To fix this vulnerability, we need to add a check for negative values of `pps_id`. The existing check for the upper bound (64) is correct, so we'll keep that and add the lower bound check.

The patch should:
1. Check if `pps_id` is negative
2. Maintain the existing check for `pps_id >= 64`

Therefore, the patch becomes:

```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

This patch ensures that `pps_id` is within the valid range (0 to 63) before accessing `vvc->pps[pps_id]`, preventing both negative index access and out-of-bounds access for values 64 and above.
