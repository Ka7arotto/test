To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Analysis:
   - The function `read_public_key` declares a buffer `buf` with a fixed size of 2048 bytes.
   - `bufsize` is set to `file->size`, which is the size of the selected file.

2. Vulnerable Operation:
   - The `sc_read_binary` function is called with `buf` and `bufsize` as parameters.
   - This function reads `count` (which is `bufsize` in this case) bytes into `buf`.

3. Potential Overflow:
   - If `file->size` is larger than 2048, `bufsize` will be set to a value larger than the actual size of `buf`.
   - This could lead to a buffer overflow in `sc_read_binary` when writing to `buf`.

4. Vulnerability Confirmation:
   - The CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability is present because there's no check to ensure `bufsize` doesn't exceed the actual size of `buf`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Constraint Identification:
   - We need to ensure that `bufsize` never exceeds the actual size of `buf` (2048 bytes).

2. Solution Formulation:
   - Use the `MIN` macro to limit `bufsize` to the smaller of `file->size` and `sizeof buf`.
   - This ensures that `bufsize` will never be larger than the actual buffer size.

3. Patch Generation:
   Replace the line:
   ```c
   bufsize = file->size;
   ```
   with:
   ```c
   bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
   ```

This patch effectively prevents the buffer overflow by ensuring that `bufsize` is never larger than the actual size of the `buf` array, thus addressing the CWE-787 vulnerability.
