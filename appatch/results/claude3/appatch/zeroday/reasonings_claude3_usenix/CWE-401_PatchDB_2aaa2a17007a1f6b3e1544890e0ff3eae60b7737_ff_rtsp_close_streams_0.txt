To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Identify the resource allocation:
   - The code iterates over `rt->rtsp_streams`, which is an array of `RTSPStream` pointers.
   - Each `rtsp_st` is a dynamically allocated `RTSPStream` object.

2. Analyze the resource deallocation:
   - The code closes dynamic handlers if they exist.
   - However, there's no deallocation of the `rtsp_st` object itself.

3. Identify the memory leak:
   - After the loop, `av_free(rt->rtsp_streams)` is called, which frees the array holding the pointers.
   - But the individual `RTSPStream` objects pointed to by each element are not freed.
   - This results in a memory leak (CWE-401) for each `RTSPStream` object.

4. Potential consequences:
   - Over time, this can lead to significant memory consumption.
   - In long-running applications or those that frequently create and close streams, this could cause out-of-memory conditions.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Determine the appropriate fix:
   - Each `RTSPStream` object needs to be freed individually before freeing the array.
   - The best place to do this is within the existing loop, after any cleanup operations for the stream.

2. Implement the fix:
   - Add `av_free(rtsp_st);` after the existing cleanup code for each stream.
   - This ensures that each `RTSPStream` object is properly deallocated.

3. Verify the fix:
   - The new code frees each `rtsp_st` object.
   - The existing `av_free(rt->rtsp_streams);` will still correctly free the array itself.

4. Consider edge cases:
   - The existing null check `if (rtsp_st)` ensures we don't try to free a null pointer.

Therefore, the appropriate patch is:

```
<             }
<         }
---
>             }
>             av_free(rtsp_st);
>         }
```

This patch adds the necessary deallocation of each `RTSPStream` object, fixing the memory leak while maintaining the existing structure and checks of the code.
