To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Identify the vulnerability:
   - The code has a CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability.
   - The vulnerability occurs at line 33, which is inside the if-block checking for a failed ioremap_cache operation.

2. Analyze the code flow:
   - At line 18, memory is allocated for 'node' using kmalloc.
   - If the subsequent ioremap_cache fails (line 28), the code jumps to the error handling section (err_dir) without freeing 'node'.

3. Understand the consequences:
   - If ioremap_cache fails, the allocated memory for 'node' is never freed.
   - This results in a memory leak, as the allocated memory becomes inaccessible but is not released back to the system.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Identify the fix requirement:
   - We need to ensure that the memory allocated for 'node' is freed if ioremap_cache fails.

2. Determine the appropriate location for the fix:
   - The fix should be applied just before setting the error code and jumping to the error handling section.
   - This ensures that the memory is freed in all error cases.

3. Implement the fix:
   - Add a call to kfree(node) before setting the error code.
   - This will release the memory allocated for 'node' if ioremap_cache fails.

4. Verify the fix:
   - The added kfree(node) will prevent the memory leak by ensuring that the allocated memory is always freed in case of an error.

Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<             {
<                 error = -ENXIO;
---
>             {
>                 kfree(node);
>                 error = -ENXIO;
```

This patch adds the necessary memory deallocation (kfree(node)) before setting the error code, effectively preventing the memory leak in case of a failed ioremap_cache operation.
