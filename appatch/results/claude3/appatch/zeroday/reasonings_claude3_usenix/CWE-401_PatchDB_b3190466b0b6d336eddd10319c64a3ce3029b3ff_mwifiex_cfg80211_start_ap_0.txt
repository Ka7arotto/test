To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Identify the allocation:
   - Line 13: `bss_cfg = kzalloc(sizeof(mwifiex_uap_bss_param), GFP_KERNEL);`
   - Memory is dynamically allocated for `bss_cfg`.

2. Identify potential exit points:
   - Line 42: `return -EINVAL;` in the default case of the switch statement.
   - This is an early return that exits the function without freeing `bss_cfg`.

3. Analyze the vulnerability:
   - If the function reaches the default case in the switch statement, it returns immediately.
   - The allocated memory for `bss_cfg` is not freed before this return.
   - This leads to a memory leak (CWE-401: Memory Leak).

4. Check other exit points:
   - Other exit points in the function (lines 46-47, 53-54, 59-60) properly free `bss_cfg` before returning.
   - The vulnerability is specific to the default case in the switch statement.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Identify the fix requirement:
   - We need to ensure that `bss_cfg` is freed before returning in the default case.

2. Determine the appropriate fix:
   - Add a `kfree(bss_cfg);` statement before the `return -EINVAL;` in the default case.
   - This ensures that the allocated memory is properly released.

3. Implement the fix:
   - Modify the default case to include the memory deallocation:
     ```c
     default:
         kfree(bss_cfg);
         return -EINVAL;
     ```

4. Verify the fix:
   - The added `kfree(bss_cfg);` statement ensures that the allocated memory is freed before the function returns.
   - This prevents the memory leak in the default case of the switch statement.

By following these steps, we arrive at the provided patch, which addresses the CWE-401 (Memory Leak) vulnerability by properly freeing the allocated memory before returning from the function in all cases.
