To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Memory Allocation:
   - Line 6 allocates memory for 'destination' using calloc().
   - This memory is dynamically allocated on the heap.

2. Memory Usage:
   - The function uses 'destination' to store the unescaped version of 'source'.
   - At line 29, the contents of 'destination' are copied back to 'source'.

3. Function Exit:
   - The function ends immediately after the strcpy() operation.
   - There's no deallocation of the memory allocated for 'destination'.

4. Potential Vulnerability:
   - The dynamically allocated memory for 'destination' is not freed before the function exits.
   - This leads to a memory leak (CWE-401), as the allocated memory remains inaccessible but not released back to the system.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability is a memory leak caused by failing to free the dynamically allocated memory before the function exits.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Identify the Resource:
   - The resource that needs to be freed is 'destination'.

2. Determine the Appropriate Location:
   - The memory should be freed after it's no longer needed.
   - In this case, it's right after the strcpy() operation.

3. Apply the Fix:
   - Add a call to free(destination) just before the function returns.

Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<     strcpy(source, destination);
< }
---
>     strcpy(source, destination);
>     free(destination);
> }
```

This patch adds the necessary free() call to release the memory allocated for 'destination', preventing the memory leak.
