Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int wm8994_get_retune_mobile_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The function `wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block()` returns an integer `block`.
   - There's no check on the value of `block` before it's used as an array index.

2. Array Access:
   - `block` is used to index `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[]`.
   - If `block` is negative or exceeds the array bounds, it will cause an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block()` returns a negative value, it will lead to an invalid memory access.
   - This could cause undefined behavior, program crashes, or potential information leaks.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because there's no validation of the `block` value before it's used as an array index. A negative value for `block` would cause an out-of-bounds read.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Input Validation:
   - Add a check to ensure `block` is non-negative before using it as an array index.

2. Error Handling:
   - If `block` is negative, return an error code instead of proceeding with the invalid array access.

3. Code Structure:
   - Place the check immediately after obtaining the `block` value.
   - Only proceed with the array access if the check passes.

Therefore, the patch should:
1. Check if `block` is negative.
2. Return the error code (which is `block` itself) if it's negative.
3. Only proceed with the array access if `block` is non-negative.

This leads to the provided patch:

```
>     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (block < 0)
>     {
>         return block;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```

This patch effectively prevents the out-of-bounds read vulnerability by ensuring `block` is non-negative before using it as an array index.

```

17 	if (card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary)   {
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Analysis:
   - The function `read_public_key` declares a buffer `buf` with a fixed size of 2048 bytes.
   - `bufsize` is set to `file->size`, which is the size of the selected file.

2. Vulnerability Identification:
   - The `sc_read_binary` function is called with `bufsize` as the count parameter.
   - If `file->size` is larger than 2048, it will attempt to read more data than `buf` can hold.

3. Potential Consequences:
   - This can lead to a buffer overflow, writing beyond the bounds of `buf`.
   - It's a classic example of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

4. Vulnerability Confirmation:
   - The vulnerability occurs because there's no check to ensure that `bufsize` doesn't exceed the actual size of `buf`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Constraint Identification:
   - We need to ensure that `bufsize` never exceeds the actual size of `buf`.

2. Solution Formulation:
   - Use the `MIN` macro to limit `bufsize` to the smaller of `file->size` and `sizeof buf`.
   - This ensures that we never attempt to read more data than `buf` can hold.

3. Patch Generation:
   Replace the line:
   ```c
   bufsize = file->size;
   ```
   with:
   ```c
   bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
   ```

4. Verification:
   - This patch ensures that `bufsize` will never be larger than 2048 (the size of `buf`).
   - It prevents potential buffer overflows while still allowing the function to read as much data as possible within the buffer's limits.

This patch effectively mitigates the CWE-125 vulnerability by ensuring that the read operation never attempts to access memory beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer.
