```
1 BOOL glyph_cache_put(rdpGlyphCache* glyphCache, UINT32 id, UINT32 index, rdpGlyph* glyph)
3 	rdpGlyph* prevGlyph;
5 	if (id > 9)
11 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
I'll provide the reasoning steps for generating this patch following the two-step process:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The function takes parameters `id` and `index`.
   - There's a check for `id > 9`, but no upper bound is enforced.
   - `index` is compared with `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number`, but the comparison is non-inclusive (>).

2. Array Access:
   - The vulnerable line accesses `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index]`.
   - This suggests that `entries` is an array within the `glyphCache` structure.

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - The check `if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)` allows `index` to be equal to `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number`.
   - In most programming languages, array indices start at 0, so the valid range is 0 to (number - 1).
   - Allowing `index` to be equal to `number` can lead to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because the check allows `index` to be equal to the number of entries, which is one beyond the last valid index. This can result in reading memory outside the allocated array, leading to undefined behavior or potential information disclosure.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `index` is strictly less than the number of entries. This can be achieved by changing the comparison operator from `>` to `>=`. The patch should be:

```
< 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
---
> 	if (index >= glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
```

This change ensures that `index` is always less than the number of entries, preventing access to out-of-bounds memory. The `>=` operator will catch both cases where `index` is greater than or equal to the number of entries, effectively preventing the out-of-bounds read.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_sps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, u8 layer_id, u32 *vui_flag_pos)
5 	HEVC_SPS *sps;
14 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
15 	if (vps_id >= 16) {
31 	sps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "sps_id");
32 	if ((sps_id < 0) || (sps_id >= 16)) {
36 	sps = &hevc->sps[sps_id];
37 	if (!sps->state) {
38 		sps->state = 1;
39 		sps->id = sps_id;
40 		sps->vps_id = vps_id;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
40 		sps->vps_id = vps_id;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `vps_id` from the bitstream using `gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id")`.
   - This function reads 4 bits, which can represent values from 0 to 15 (2^4 - 1).

2. Bounds Checking:
   - The code checks if `vps_id >= 16`, which correctly catches values that are too large.
   - However, it doesn't check for negative values.

3. Usage of vps_id:
   - `vps_id` is later assigned to `sps->vps_id` without any additional checks.

4. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `vps_id` is negative, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read when used to index an array or access memory.
   - This matches the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability arises because the code doesn't check for negative values of `vps_id`. A negative `vps_id` could lead to out-of-bounds memory access when used later in the program.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To address this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range (0 to 15) before using it. This can be achieved by:

1. Adding a check for negative values in addition to the existing check for values >= 16.
2. Combining these checks into a single condition to ensure `vps_id` is within the valid range.

Therefore, the patch should be:

```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) {
---
> 	if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) {
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is non-negative and less than 16, covering the full range of valid values for a 4-bit integer.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static struct phy *serdes_simple_xlate(struct device *dev,
2 				       struct of_phandle_args *args)
4 	struct serdes_ctrl *ctrl = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
5 	unsigned int port, idx, i;
7 	if (args->args_count != 2)
11 	idx = args->args[1];
13 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
14 		struct serdes_macro *macro = phy_get_drvdata(ctrl->phys[i]);
16 		if (idx != macro->idx)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 		struct serdes_macro *macro = phy_get_drvdata(ctrl->phys[i]);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Analysis:
   - The loop iterates from 0 to SERDES_MAX, inclusive (i <= SERDES_MAX).
   - ctrl->phys is an array, likely of size SERDES_MAX.

2. Array Access:
   - Inside the loop, ctrl->phys[i] is accessed.
   - The last iteration accesses ctrl->phys[SERDES_MAX].

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If ctrl->phys has SERDES_MAX elements, the valid indices are 0 to SERDES_MAX - 1.
   - Accessing ctrl->phys[SERDES_MAX] would be out of bounds, causing a buffer over-read (CWE-125).

4. Vulnerability Confirmation:
   - The CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is reported for this line, confirming our analysis.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because the loop allows i to reach SERDES_MAX, which is likely one beyond the last valid index of ctrl->phys.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Boundary Adjustment:
   - To fix this, we need to ensure that i never reaches SERDES_MAX.
   - Change the loop condition from i <= SERDES_MAX to i < SERDES_MAX.

2. Patch Formulation:
   - Replace "for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++)" with "for (i = 0; i < SERDES_MAX; i++)".

3. Verification:
   - This change ensures that i only goes from 0 to SERDES_MAX - 1, which should be the valid range for ctrl->phys.
   - It prevents accessing the out-of-bounds element at index SERDES_MAX.

Therefore, the appropriate patch is:
```
< 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
---
> 	for (i = 0; i < SERDES_MAX; i++) {
```

This patch addresses the CWE-125 vulnerability by ensuring that the loop doesn't access beyond the bounds of the ctrl->phys array.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int wm8994_get_retune_mobile_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The function `wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block()` returns an integer `block`.
   - There's no check on the value of `block` before it's used as an array index.

2. Array Access:
   - `block` is used to index `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[]`.
   - If `block` is negative or exceeds the array bounds, it will cause an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block()` returns a negative value, it will lead to an invalid memory access.
   - This could cause undefined behavior, program crashes, or potential information leaks.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because there's no validation of the `block` value before it's used as an array index. A negative value for `block` would cause an out-of-bounds read.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Input Validation:
   - Add a check to ensure `block` is non-negative before using it as an array index.

2. Error Handling:
   - If `block` is negative, return an error code instead of proceeding with the invalid array access.

3. Code Structure:
   - Place the check immediately after obtaining the `block` value.
   - Only proceed with the array access if the check passes.

Therefore, the patch should:
1. Check if `block` is negative.
2. Return the error code (which is `block` itself) if it's negative.
3. Only proceed with the array access if `block` is non-negative.

This leads to the provided patch:

```
>     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (block < 0)
>     {
>         return block;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```

This patch effectively prevents the out-of-bounds read vulnerability by ensuring `block` is non-negative before using it as an array index.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static __u8 *sp_report_fixup(struct hid_device *hdev, __u8 *rdesc,
2 		unsigned int *rsize)
4 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
7 		rdesc[105] = rdesc[110] = 0x03;
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The function takes a pointer `rdesc` and a size `*rsize`.
   - The code checks if `*rsize >= 107` before accessing elements of `rdesc`.

2. Array Access:
   - The code accesses `rdesc` at indices 104, 105, 106, 110, and 111.
   - The highest index accessed is 111.

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - The check `*rsize >= 107` only ensures that indices up to 106 are safe to access.
   - However, the code accesses `rdesc[110]` and `rdesc[111]`, which are beyond the checked size.
   - This can lead to out-of-bounds read/write if `*rsize` is between 107 and 111.

4. Vulnerability Classification:
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability because it may read beyond the allocated buffer.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Correct Bound Checking:
   - To safely access `rdesc[111]`, we need to ensure that `*rsize` is at least 112 (since array indices start at 0).
   - The fix should change the size check from 107 to 112.

2. Minimal Change:
   - The simplest fix is to update the condition in the if statement.
   - Change `*rsize >= 107` to `*rsize >= 112`.

3. Resulting Patch:
```
< 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
---
> 	if (*rsize >= 112 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
```

This patch ensures that all accessed elements of `rdesc` are within bounds, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
5 	s32 vps_id;
6 	HEVC_VPS *vps;
10 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
12 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
I'll provide the reasoning steps for generating this patch following the two-step process:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input validation:
   - The code reads `vps_id` from a bitstream using `gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id")`.
   - This function reads 4 bits, which can represent values from 0 to 15 (2^4 - 1).

2. Existing check:
   - The code checks if `vps_id >= 16`, returning -1 if true.
   - This check prevents accessing array indices 16 and above.

3. Potential vulnerability:
   - The existing check doesn't account for negative values of `vps_id`.
   - If `vps_id` is negative, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]`.
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because the code doesn't check for negative values of `vps_id`. A negative `vps_id` could cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `hevc->vps` array.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range for array indexing (0 to 15). This can be achieved by adding a check for negative values in addition to the existing upper bound check.

The patch should:
1. Check if `vps_id` is less than 0
2. Maintain the existing check for `vps_id >= 16`
3. Return -1 if either condition is true

Therefore, the appropriate patch is:

```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range of 0 to 15, preventing both negative index accesses and accesses beyond the array bounds.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 s32 hevc_parse_slice_segment(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, HEVCSliceInfo *si)
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
7 	s32 pps_id;
31 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
32 	if (pps_id >= 64)
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `pps_id` using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id")`.
   - This function likely returns an unsigned integer, but `pps_id` is declared as `s32` (signed 32-bit integer).

2. Bounds Checking:
   - The code checks if `pps_id >= 64`, which prevents accessing array indices 64 and above.
   - However, it doesn't check for negative values of `pps_id`.

3. Array Access:
   - The array `hevc->pps` is accessed using `pps_id` as the index.
   - If `pps_id` is negative, it would result in accessing memory before the start of the array, causing a buffer underflow.

4. Vulnerability:
   - The CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability occurs because negative values of `pps_id` are not prevented from being used as array indices.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Comprehensive Bounds Checking:
   - To fix this vulnerability, we need to check for both upper and lower bounds of `pps_id`.
   - The lower bound should be 0 (as array indices cannot be negative).
   - The upper bound remains 63 (as the check for >= 64 was already in place).

2. Patch Implementation:
   - Modify the condition to check for both negative values and values greater than or equal to 64.
   - The new condition should be: `(pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64)`

3. Resulting Patch:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

This patch ensures that `pps_id` is within the valid range [0, 63] before it's used to access the `hevc->pps` array, preventing both buffer underflow and overflow conditions.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static __u8 *kye_report_fixup(struct hid_device *hdev, __u8 *rdesc,
2 		unsigned int *rsize)
4 	switch (hdev->product) {
13 		if (*rsize >= 74 &&
22 			rdesc[62] = 0x09;
23 			rdesc[64] = 0x04;
24 			rdesc[66] = 0x07;
25 			rdesc[72] = 0x01;
26 			rdesc[74] = 0x08;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
26 			rdesc[74] = 0x08;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input validation:
   - The function takes a pointer `rdesc` and a size `*rsize`.
   - There's a condition checking if `*rsize >= 74`.

2. Array access:
   - The code accesses `rdesc` at indices 62, 64, 66, 72, and 74.
   - The highest index accessed is 74.

3. Potential vulnerability:
   - CWE-125 is "Out-of-bounds Read", but this case involves a write operation.
   - The vulnerability occurs because the code writes to `rdesc[74]` when `*rsize` could be exactly 74.
   - Array indices in C start at 0, so an array of size 74 has valid indices 0 to 73.

4. Conclusion:
   - The root cause is insufficient bounds checking. The condition `*rsize >= 74` allows access to index 74, which is out of bounds for an array of size 74.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. To ensure safe access to index 74, we need to guarantee that `*rsize` is at least 75.
2. This can be achieved by modifying the condition from `*rsize >= 74` to `*rsize >= 75`.
3. This change ensures that there are at least 75 elements in the array, making it safe to access index 74.

Therefore, the appropriate patch is:

```
< 		if (*rsize >= 74 &&
---
> 		if (*rsize >= 75 &&
```

This patch increases the minimum required size by 1, preventing out-of-bounds access when writing to `rdesc[74]`.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_media_vvc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)

5 	VVC_VPS *vps;
9 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
10 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `vps_id` from a bitstream using `gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id")`.
   - This function reads 4 bits, which can represent values from 0 to 15.

2. Existing Check:
   - There's a check `if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;` to ensure `vps_id` is not too large.

3. Array Access:
   - The code accesses `vvc->vps[vps_id]` without checking if `vps_id` is negative.

4. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `vps_id` is negative, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `vvc->vps[vps_id]`.
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

5. Missing Check:
   - The code lacks a check for negative values of `vps_id`.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability arises because the code doesn't check for negative values of `vps_id` before using it as an array index. While `gf_bs_read_int_log` likely returns an unsigned value, the `vps_id` is declared as `s32` (signed 32-bit integer), allowing for potential negative values.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To address this vulnerability, we need to add a check for negative values of `vps_id`. The existing check for values >= 16 is correct, but we should extend it to include negative values as well.

The patch should:
1. Check if `vps_id` is negative.
2. Combine this check with the existing check for values >= 16.
3. Return an error code if either condition is true.

Therefore, the appropriate patch is:

```
< 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
> 	if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range (0 to 15) before it's used as an array index, preventing both negative index access and out-of-bounds access for values 16 and above.
