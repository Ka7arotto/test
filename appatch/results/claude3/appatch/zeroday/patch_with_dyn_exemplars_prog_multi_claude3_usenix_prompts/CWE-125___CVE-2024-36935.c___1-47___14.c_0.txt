```
1 s32 hevc_parse_slice_segment(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, HEVCSliceInfo *si)
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
7 	s32 pps_id;
31 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
32 	if (pps_id >= 64)
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `pps_id` using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id")`.
   - This function likely returns an unsigned integer, but `pps_id` is declared as `s32` (signed 32-bit integer).

2. Bounds Checking:
   - The code checks if `pps_id >= 64`, which prevents accessing array indices 64 and above.
   - However, it doesn't check for negative values of `pps_id`.

3. Array Access:
   - The array `hevc->pps` is accessed using `pps_id` as the index.
   - If `pps_id` is negative, it would result in accessing memory before the start of the array, causing a buffer underflow.

4. Vulnerability:
   - The CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability occurs because negative values of `pps_id` are not prevented from being used as array indices.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Comprehensive Bounds Checking:
   - To fix this vulnerability, we need to check for both upper and lower bounds of `pps_id`.
   - The lower bound should be 0 (as array indices cannot be negative).
   - The upper bound remains 63 (as the check for >= 64 was already in place).

2. Patch Implementation:
   - Modify the condition to check for both negative values and values greater than or equal to 64.
   - The new condition should be: `(pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64)`

3. Resulting Patch:
```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

This patch ensures that `pps_id` is within the valid range [0, 63] before it's used to access the `hevc->pps` array, preventing both buffer underflow and overflow conditions.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_pps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc)
4 	s32 pps_id;
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
8 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
10 	if ((pps_id < 0) || (pps_id >= 64)) {
14 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
16 	if (!pps->state) {
17 		pps->id = pps_id;
18 		pps->state = 1;
20 	pps->sps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "sps_id");
21 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
21 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
I'll provide the reasoning steps for generating this patch following the two-step process:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `pps_id` using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id")`.
   - It checks if `pps_id` is within the range [0, 63].

2. Array Access:
   - `pps` is assigned using `hevc->pps[pps_id]`, which is safe due to the previous check.

3. SPS ID Reading:
   - `pps->sps_id` is read using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "sps_id")`.
   - The code checks if `pps->sps_id >= 16`.

4. Potential Vulnerability:
   - The check `pps->sps_id >= 16` only guards against values that are too high.
   - It doesn't protect against negative values, which could lead to out-of-bounds access.
   - `gf_bs_read_ue_log` likely returns a signed 32-bit integer (s32), so negative values are possible.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability arises because the code doesn't check for negative values of `pps->sps_id`. If `pps->sps_id` is negative, it could lead to out-of-bounds array access when used as an index elsewhere in the code.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To address this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps->sps_id` is within the valid range [0, 15]. This can be achieved by modifying the condition to check for both lower and upper bounds:

```
< 	if (pps->sps_id >= 16) {
---
> 	if ((pps->sps_id < 0) || (pps->sps_id >= 16)) {
```

This patch:
1. Adds a check for negative values: `pps->sps_id < 0`
2. Maintains the existing upper bound check: `pps->sps_id >= 16`
3. Combines both conditions using the OR operator `||`

This ensures that `pps->sps_id` is within the valid range [0, 15], preventing potential out-of-bounds access and addressing the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 s32 vvc_parse_picture_header(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, VVCSliceInfo *si)
3 	u32 pps_id;
5 	si->irap_or_gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "irap_or_gdr_pic");
6 	si->non_ref_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "non_ref_pic");
7 	if (si->irap_or_gdr_pic)
8 		si->gdr_pic = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "gdr_pic");
9 	if ((si->inter_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "inter_slice_allowed_flag")))
10 		si->intra_slice_allowed_flag = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 1, "intra_slice_allowed_flag");
12 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
13 	if (pps_id >= 64)
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	si->pps = &vvc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `pps_id` using `gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id")`.
   - This function likely returns an unsigned integer (u32).

2. Bounds Checking:
   - The code checks if `pps_id >= 64`, but doesn't check for a lower bound.
   - The array access `vvc->pps[pps_id]` assumes `pps_id` is non-negative.

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `pps_id` is negative, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `vvc->pps[pps_id]`.
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because the code doesn't check for negative values of `pps_id`. Although `pps_id` is likely unsigned, it's safer to explicitly check for negative values to prevent potential issues if the type changes or if there's unexpected behavior in `gf_bs_read_ue_log()`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To fix this vulnerability, we need to add a check for negative values of `pps_id`. The existing check for the upper bound (64) is correct, so we'll keep that and add the lower bound check.

The patch should:
1. Check if `pps_id` is negative
2. Maintain the existing check for `pps_id >= 64`

Therefore, the patch becomes:

```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

This patch ensures that `pps_id` is within the valid range (0 to 63) before accessing `vvc->pps[pps_id]`, preventing both negative index access and out-of-bounds access for values 64 and above.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int drxj_dap_atomic_read_reg32(struct i2c_device_addr *dev_addr, u32 addr, u32 *data, u32 flags)
3     u8 buf[sizeof(*data)];
6     if (!data)
11     word = (u32)buf[3];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
11     word = (u32)buf[3];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
I'll provide the reasoning steps for generating this patch following the two-step process:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input validation:
   - The function takes a pointer 'data' as input, which is checked for NULL.
   - However, there's no check on the return value of 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block'.

2. Buffer usage:
   - A buffer 'buf' is declared with size 'sizeof(*data)'.
   - 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block' is called to fill this buffer.
   - The code then directly accesses 'buf[3]' without checking if the read operation was successful.

3. Potential vulnerability:
   - If 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block' fails (returns a negative value), 'buf' might not be properly initialized.
   - Accessing 'buf[3]' in this case could lead to reading uninitialized or out-of-bounds memory.
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because the code doesn't check the return value of 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block' before accessing 'buf'. If this function fails, accessing 'buf[3]' could lead to undefined behavior or information disclosure.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To fix this vulnerability, we need to:
1. Check the return value of 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block'.
2. Only proceed with accessing 'buf' if the read operation was successful.

The patch implements this strategy by:
1. Adding a check for the return value 'rc' after calling 'drxj_dap_atomic_read_write_block'.
2. If 'rc' is negative (indicating an error), the function returns early with a value of 0.
3. Only if the read operation succeeds does the code proceed to access 'buf[3]'.

This patch ensures that 'buf' is only accessed when it has been properly initialized, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:

   - This function likely returns an unsigned integer, but `pps_id` is declared as `s32` (signed 32-bit integer).

2. Bounds Checking:

3. Array Access:
   - The array `hevc->pps` is accessed using `pps_id` as the index.

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_media_vvc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
4 	s32 vps_id;
5 	VVC_VPS *vps;
9 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
10 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code reads `vps_id` from a bitstream using `gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id")`.
   - This function reads 4 bits, which can represent values from 0 to 15 (2^4 - 1).

2. Existing Check:
   - There's a check `if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;` to ensure `vps_id` is not too large.
   - However, there's no check for negative values.

3. Variable Type:
   - `vps_id` is declared as `s32`, which is a signed 32-bit integer.
   - This means `vps_id` can potentially hold negative values.

4. Array Access:
   - The code accesses `vvc->vps[vps_id]` without checking if `vps_id` is negative.
   - Negative array indices can lead to out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).

5. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `vps_id` is negative, it will cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing `vvc->vps[vps_id]`.
   - This can lead to reading unintended memory locations, potentially causing crashes or information leaks.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability arises because the code doesn't check for negative values of `vps_id` before using it as an array index. While it checks for values that are too large, it fails to account for the possibility of negative values, which can also cause out-of-bounds access.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

To fix this vulnerability, we need to add a check for negative values of `vps_id`. The existing check for values >= 16 is correct and should be kept. We can combine both checks into a single condition:

```c
if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

This patch ensures that:
1. `vps_id` is not negative, preventing potential out-of-bounds read for negative indices.
2. `vps_id` is less than 16, maintaining the existing upper bound check.

By implementing this fix, we ensure that `vps_id` is always within the valid range [0, 15] before it's used as an array index, thus preventing the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int wm8994_get_retune_mobile_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The function `wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block()` returns an integer `block`.
   - There's no check on the value of `block` before it's used as an array index.

2. Array Access:
   - `block` is used to index `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[]`.
   - If `block` is negative or exceeds the array bounds, it will cause an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - If `wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block()` returns a negative value, it will lead to an invalid memory access.
   - This could cause undefined behavior, program crashes, or potential information leaks.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability occurs because there's no validation of the `block` value before it's used as an array index. A negative value for `block` would cause an out-of-bounds read.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Input Validation:
   - Add a check to ensure `block` is non-negative before using it as an array index.

2. Error Handling:
   - If `block` is negative, return an error code instead of proceeding with the invalid array access.

3. Code Structure:
   - Place the check immediately after obtaining the `block` value.
   - Only proceed with the array access if the check passes.

Therefore, the patch should:
1. Check if `block` is negative.
2. Return the error code (which is `block` itself) if it's negative.
3. Only proceed with the array access if `block` is non-negative.

This leads to the provided patch:

```
>     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (block < 0)
>     {
>         return block;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```

This patch effectively prevents the out-of-bounds read vulnerability by ensuring `block` is non-negative before using it as an array index.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static __u8 *sp_report_fixup(struct hid_device *hdev, __u8 *rdesc,
2 		unsigned int *rsize)
4 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
7 		rdesc[105] = rdesc[110] = 0x03;
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
To generate this patch, we can follow these reasoning steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis:

1. Input Validation:
   - The function takes a pointer `rdesc` and a size `*rsize`.
   - The code checks if `*rsize >= 107` before accessing elements of `rdesc`.

2. Array Access:
   - The code accesses `rdesc` at indices 104, 105, 106, 110, and 111.
   - The highest index accessed is 111.

3. Potential Vulnerability:
   - The check `*rsize >= 107` only ensures that indices up to 106 are safe to access.
   - However, the code accesses `rdesc[110]` and `rdesc[111]`, which are beyond the checked size.
   - This can lead to out-of-bounds read/write if `*rsize` is between 107 and 111.

4. Vulnerability Classification:
   - This is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability because it may read beyond the allocated buffer.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy:

1. Correct Bound Checking:
   - To safely access `rdesc[111]`, we need to ensure that `*rsize` is at least 112 (since array indices start at 0).
   - The fix should change the size check from 107 to 112.

2. Minimal Change:
   - The simplest fix is to update the condition in the if statement.
   - Change `*rsize >= 107` to `*rsize >= 112`.

3. Resulting Patch:
```
< 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
---
> 	if (*rsize >= 112 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
```

This patch ensures that all accessed elements of `rdesc` are within bounds, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
