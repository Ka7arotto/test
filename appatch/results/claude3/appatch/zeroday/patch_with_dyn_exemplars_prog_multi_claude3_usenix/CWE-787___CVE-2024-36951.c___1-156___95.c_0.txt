Step 1: pologize, but I don't see a clear CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability in the provided code slice, particularly at line 95. The line you've indicated:

```
95 		} else if (source_id == SOC15_INTSRC_CP_BAD_OPCODE) {
```

is simply a conditional statement checking the value of `source_id`. This operation by itself does not involve any write operations, let alone out-of-bounds writes.

To reason about potential vulnerabilities, we would need to see:

1. How `source_id` is defined and its possible range of values.
2. What operations are performed inside this conditional block.
3. Any array or buffer manipulations that could potentially lead to out-of-bounds writes.

Without more context or code showing actual write operations, it's not possible to identify a CWE-787 vulnerability at this line. The provided code snippet doesn't show any array indexing or pointer arithmetic that could lead to out-of-bounds writes.

If there is indeed a vulnerability here, it would likely be in the code that follows this conditional statement, which is not shown in the provided snippet. To properly analyze for CWE-787, we would need to see the complete function, especially any parts that involve buffer or array manipulations.
I apologize for the confusion, but I don't see a clear CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability in the provided code snippet, particularly at line 95. The line you've indicated:

```c
95 		} else if (source_id == SOC15_INTSRC_CP_BAD_OPCODE) {
```

is simply a conditional statement checking the value of `source_id`. This operation by itself does not involve any write operations, let alone out-of-bounds writes.

To properly identify and patch a CWE-787 vulnerability, we would need to see:

1. How `source_id` is defined and its possible range of values.
2. What operations are performed inside this conditional block.
3. Any array or buffer manipulations that could potentially lead to out-of-bounds writes.

Without more context or code showing actual write operations, it's not possible to generate meaningful patches for a CWE-787 vulnerability at this line.

If you have additional information or context about where the actual out-of-bounds write might occur, please provide it, and I'd be happy to suggest appropriate patches.
