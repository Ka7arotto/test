To analyze the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability in the given code, let's follow the data flow and examine the potential for integer overflow:

1. Input parameters:
   - pDstData: pointer to destination data
   - nXDst, nYDst: destination coordinates
   - nDstStep: step size for destination data
   - dstBytesPerPixel: bytes per pixel for destination format

2. Vulnerable line:
   const BYTE* pDstStart = &pDstData[nXDst * dstBytesPerPixel + nYDst * nDstStep];

3. Potential overflow points:
   a. nXDst * dstBytesPerPixel
   b. nYDst * nDstStep
   c. The sum of these two products

4. Analysis of overflow risks:
   a. nXDst * dstBytesPerPixel:
      - Both nXDst and dstBytesPerPixel are unsigned integers (UINT32)
      - If either is very large, their product could overflow

   b. nYDst * nDstStep:
      - Both nYDst and nDstStep are unsigned integers (UINT32)
      - If either is very large, their product could overflow

   c. Sum of the products:
      - Even if individual products don't overflow, their sum might

5. Consequences of overflow:
   - If overflow occurs, pDstStart will point to an incorrect memory location
   - This could lead to buffer overflow, memory corruption, or accessing unintended data

6. Lack of bounds checking:
   - The code doesn't check for potential overflow before performing these calculations
   - There are no safeguards against large input values that could cause overflow

7. Context from freerdp_image_copy function:
   - Some input validation is performed (e.g., checking for NULL pointers, maximum height and width)
   - However, there's no specific check for the values used in the vulnerable line

Conclusion:
The vulnerability arises from the lack of overflow checking in the pointer arithmetic. Large values of nXDst, nYDst, dstBytesPerPixel, or nDstStep could cause integer overflow, leading to incorrect memory access. To fix this, the code should implement checks to ensure that the calculations don't overflow, possibly by using safer arithmetic operations or by validating the input values before performing the calculation.
