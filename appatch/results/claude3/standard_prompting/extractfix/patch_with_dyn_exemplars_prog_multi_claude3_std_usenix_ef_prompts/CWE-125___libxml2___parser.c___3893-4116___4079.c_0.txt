```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_sps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, u8 layer_id, u32 *vui_flag_pos)
5 	HEVC_SPS *sps;
14 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
15 	if (vps_id >= 16) {
31 	sps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "sps_id");
32 	if ((sps_id < 0) || (sps_id >= 16)) {
36 	sps = &hevc->sps[sps_id];
37 	if (!sps->state) {
38 		sps->state = 1;
39 		sps->id = sps_id;
40 		sps->vps_id = vps_id;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
40 		sps->vps_id = vps_id;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists because the value of `vps_id` is not properly validated before being used to access the `hevc->sps` array. Specifically, the code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, but it does not check if `vps_id` is less than 0. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->sps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within a valid range before using it to access the `hevc->sps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) {
---
>    if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) {
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range of 0 to 15 before proceeding with the code that uses `vps_id` to access the `hevc->sps` array. By checking for both negative values and values greater than or equal to 16, the code prevents out-of-bounds reads and mitigates the CWE-125 vulnerability.

43 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
43 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 43 `vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];` is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the value of `vps_id` is not properly checked before being used as an index to access the `hevc->vps` array. The code only checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16 (line 15), but it does not check if `vps_id` is less than 0. If `vps_id` is negative, it can cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `hevc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<   if (vps_id >= 16) {
---
>   if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) {
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is checked for both negative values and values greater than or equal to 16, which are invalid indices for the `hevc->vps` array. By doing this, the code prevents out-of-bounds reads and mitigates the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 void gdImageFillToBorder (gdImagePtr im, int x, int y, int border, int color)
8 	if (border < 0) {
13 	if (!im->trueColor) {
14 		if ((color > (im->colorsTotal - 1)) || (border > (im->colorsTotal - 1)) || (color < 0)) {
20 	im->alphaBlendingFlag = 0;
22 	if (x >= im->sx) {
23 		x = im->sx - 1;
24 	} else if (x < 0) {
25 		x = 0;
27 	if (y >= im->sy) {
28 		y = im->sy - 1;
29 	} else if (y < 0) {
30 		y = 0;
33 	for (i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
34 		if (gdImageGetPixel(im, i, y) == border) {
37 		gdImageSetPixel(im, i, y, color);```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
37 		gdImageSetPixel(im, i, y, color);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists in the code because the function `gdImageGetPixel` is called with the pixel coordinates `i` and `y`, which are not properly validated against the image dimensions `im->sx` and `im->sy`. If `i` or `y` is out of bounds, `gdImageGetPixel` will read from an invalid memory location, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

Although the code checks if `x` and `y` are within the image bounds (lines 22-30), it does not check if `i` is within the bounds when calling `gdImageGetPixel(im, i, y)` (line 34). The loop `for (i = x; i >= 0; i--)` (line 33) can potentially make `i` negative, leading to an out-of-bounds read when `gdImageGetPixel` is called.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, we need to ensure that `i` is within the image bounds before calling `gdImageGetPixel`. However, instead of adding a separate check for `i`, the patch takes a different approach by checking if the `color` value is negative or not.

The reasoning behind this patch is that if `color` is negative, it is an invalid color value, and the function `gdImageSetPixel` should not be called with an invalid color. By adding the condition `color < 0` to the existing check `border < 0` (line 8), the function will exit early if either `border` or `color` is negative, effectively preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability from occurring.

While this patch does not directly address the root cause of the vulnerability (the lack of bounds checking for `i`), it provides a workaround by avoiding the vulnerable code path altogether when `color` is invalid. This approach is likely taken because it requires fewer code changes and is easier to implement than adding a separate bounds check for `i`.
