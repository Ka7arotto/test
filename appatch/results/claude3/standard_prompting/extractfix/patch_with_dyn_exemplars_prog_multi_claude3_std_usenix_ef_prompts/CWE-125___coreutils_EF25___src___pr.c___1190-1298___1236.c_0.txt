```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_sps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, u8 layer_id, u32 *vui_flag_pos)
5 	HEVC_SPS *sps;

38 		sps->state = 1;
39 		sps->id = sps_id;
40 		sps->vps_id = vps_id;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
40 		sps->vps_id = vps_id;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists because the value of `vps_id` is not properly validated before being used to access the `hevc->sps` array. Specifically, the code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, but it does not check if `vps_id` is less than 0. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->sps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within a valid range before using it to access the `hevc->sps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) {
---
>    if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) {
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range of 0 to 15 before proceeding with the code that uses `vps_id` to access the `hevc->sps` array. By checking for both negative values and values greater than or equal to 16, the code prevents out-of-bounds reads and mitigates the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int crypto_report_comp(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3 	struct crypto_report_comp rcomp;
5 	strlcpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
5 	strlcpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability in the given code is CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The `strlcpy` function copies the string "compression" into `rcomp.type` buffer, but it does not null-terminate the destination buffer if the source string is longer than or equal to the buffer size. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read when the buffer is accessed later, as the buffer may contain uninitialized or arbitrary data beyond the end of the string.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, the `strlcpy` function should be replaced with `strncpy`, which ensures that the destination buffer is null-terminated even if the source string is longer than the buffer size. The `strncpy` function copies at most `n` bytes from the source string to the destination buffer, and it always null-terminates the destination buffer if the source string is shorter than `n`.

The patch replaces `strlcpy` with `strncpy`:

```
<    strlcpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));
---
>    strncpy(rcomp.type, "compression", sizeof(rcomp.type));
```

By using `strncpy`, the buffer `rcomp.type` will be properly null-terminated, and any out-of-bounds read beyond the end of the string will be prevented.

10 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
12 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability in the given code is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. The root cause is that the `vps_id` variable is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `hevc->vps` array. The code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, but it does not check if `vps_id` is negative. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `hevc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
>    if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

By adding the condition `(vps_id < 0)` to the `if` statement, the code now checks if `vps_id` is negative or greater than or equal to 16. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns -1, preventing an out-of-bounds read access to the `hevc->vps` array.

```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability in the given code is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. The root cause is that the `vps_id` variable is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `hevc->vps` array.

>    if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

By adding the condition `(vps_id < 0)` to the `if` statement, the code now checks if `vps_id` is negative or greater than or equal to 16. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns -1, preventing an out-of-bounds read access to the `hevc->vps` array.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int serdes_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
4 	struct serdes_ctrl *ctrl;

6 	int ret;
8 	ctrl = devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*ctrl), GFP_KERNEL);

17 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
18 		ret = serdes_phy_create(ctrl, i, &ctrl->phys[i]);
19 		if (ret)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
18 		ret = serdes_phy_create(ctrl, i, &ctrl->phys[i]);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists in the code because the loop condition `i <= SERDES_MAX` may cause an out-of-bounds access to the `ctrl->phys` array. Specifically, when `i` is equal to `SERDES_MAX`, the access to `ctrl->phys[i]` will be out-of-bounds, as the valid indices for the array should range from 0 to `SERDES_MAX-1`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the out-of-bounds read vulnerability, the loop condition needs to be modified to ensure that the index `i` stays within the valid range of the `ctrl->phys` array. This can be achieved by changing the loop condition from `i <= SERDES_MAX` to `i < SERDES_MAX`. By doing so, the loop will iterate from 0 to `SERDES_MAX-1`, which is the correct range for the `ctrl->phys` array. Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<   for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
---
>   for (i = 0; i < SERDES_MAX; i++) {
```

This patch ensures that the index `i` used to access `ctrl->phys[i]` will always be within the valid range of the array, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_media_vvc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, VVCState *vvc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
4 	s32 vps_id;
5 	VVC_VPS *vps;
9 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
10 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 15 `vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];` is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the value of `vps_id` is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `vvc->vps` array.

The code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16 (line 10), but it does not check if `vps_id` is negative. If `vps_id` is negative, it can still cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing `vvc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `vvc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is non-negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being less than 16.

Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
>    if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices (0 to 15, inclusive) for the `vvc->vps` array, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 BOOL glyph_cache_put(rdpGlyphCache* glyphCache, UINT32 id, UINT32 index, rdpGlyph* glyph)
3 	rdpGlyph* prevGlyph;
5 	if (id > 9)
11 	if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
19 	prevGlyph = glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 19 is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the condition `index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number` allows `index` to be equal to `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number`, which would result in an out-of-bounds read when accessing `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].entries[index]`. The valid range for `index` should be from 0 to `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number - 1`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to change the condition to ensure that `index` is strictly less than `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number`. This can be done by changing the strict inequality `>` to a non-strict inequality `>=`. Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<   if (index > glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
---
>   if (index >= glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number)
```

With this patch, the condition will only allow `index` to be in the valid range from 0 to `glyphCache->glyphCache[id].number - 1`, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int wm8994_get_drc_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists in the code because the value of `drc` is not checked before being used as an index to access the `wm8994->drc_cfg` array. If `wm8994_get_drc` returns a negative value, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `wm8994->drc_cfg[drc]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, we need to ensure that `drc` is a valid index before using it to access the `wm8994->drc_cfg` array. This can be done by checking if `drc` is non-negative before proceeding with the array access. The patch introduces an `if` statement to check if `drc` is less than 0, and if so, it returns the value of `drc` (which is an error code) without accessing the array.

The patch can be explained as follows:

```
<     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
<     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
---
>     int drc = wm8994_get_drc(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (drc < 0)
>     {
>         return drc;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->drc_cfg[drc];
```

1. The first line remains unchanged, as it retrieves the value of `drc` by calling `wm8994_get_drc`.
2. The next line introduces an `if` statement that checks if `drc` is less than 0.
3. If `drc` is less than 0, it means that `wm8994_get_drc` returned an error code, so the function returns the error code without accessing the array.
4. If `drc` is not less than 0, it means that `drc` is a valid index, so the code proceeds to access `wm8994->drc_cfg[drc]` and assign the value to `ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0]`.

By adding this check, the patch ensures that `drc` is a valid index before accessing the `wm8994->drc_cfg` array, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 void gdImageFillToBorder (gdImagePtr im, int x, int y, int border, int color)

34 		if (gdImageGetPixel(im, i, y) == border) {
37 		gdImageSetPixel(im, i, y, color);```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
37 		gdImageSetPixel(im, i, y, color);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists in the code because the function `gdImageGetPixel` is called with the pixel coordinates `i` and `y`, which are not properly validated against the image dimensions `im->sx` and `im->sy`. If `i` or `y` is out of bounds, `gdImageGetPixel` will read from an invalid memory location, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

Although the code checks if `x` and `y` are within the image bounds (lines 22-30), it does not check if `i` is within the bounds when calling `gdImageGetPixel(im, i, y)` (line 34). The loop `for (i = x; i >= 0; i--)` (line 33) can potentially make `i` negative, leading to an out-of-bounds read when `gdImageGetPixel` is called.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, we need to ensure that `i` is within the image bounds before calling `gdImageGetPixel`. However, instead of adding a separate check for `i`, the patch takes a different approach by checking if the `color` value is negative or not.

The reasoning behind this patch is that if `color` is negative, it is an invalid color value, and the function `gdImageSetPixel` should not be called with an invalid color. By adding the condition `color < 0` to the existing check `border < 0` (line 8), the function will exit early if either `border` or `color` is negative, effectively preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability from occurring.

While this patch does not directly address the root cause of the vulnerability (the lack of bounds checking for `i`), it provides a workaround by avoiding the vulnerable code path altogether when `color` is invalid. This approach is likely taken because it requires fewer code changes and is easier to implement than adding a separate bounds check for `i`.
