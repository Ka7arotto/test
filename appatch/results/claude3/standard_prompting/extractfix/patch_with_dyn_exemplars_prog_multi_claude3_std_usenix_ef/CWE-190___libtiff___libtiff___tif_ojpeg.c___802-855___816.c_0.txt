Step 1:  root cause of the CWE-190  vulnerability in the given code slice is:

The code performs a modulo operation (%) using the value of sp->bytes_per_line without first checking if it is zero. If sp->bytes_per_line is zero, this will result in a divide-by-zero error, which can lead to a program crash or unexpected behavior.

To prevent this vulnerability, the code should include a check to ensure that sp->bytes_per_line is not zero before performing the modulo operation. For example:

```c
if (sp->bytes_per_line != 0 && cc % sp->bytes_per_line != 0)
```

This check would prevent the divide-by-zero error by only executing the modulo operation when sp->bytes_per_line is non-zero.
Thank you for providing the context and explanation. I'll now generate five possible patches for the CWE-190  vulnerability in the given code slice. Each patch will aim to prevent the divide-by-zero error by ensuring that sp->bytes_per_line is not zero before performing the modulo operation.

Patch 1:
```c
if (sp->bytes_per_line != 0 && cc % sp->bytes_per_line != 0)
```

Patch 2:
```c
if (sp->bytes_per_line > 0 && cc % sp->bytes_per_line != 0)
```

Patch 3:
```c
if (sp->bytes_per_line && (cc % sp->bytes_per_line != 0))
```

Patch 4:
```c
int bpl = sp->bytes_per_line;
if (bpl != 0 && cc % bpl != 0)
```

Patch 5:
```c
if (sp->bytes_per_line != 0) {
    if (cc % sp->bytes_per_line != 0) {
        // Original code block
    }
}
```

Each of these patches addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that sp->bytes_per_line is not zero before performing the modulo operation, thus preventing a potential divide-by-zero error.
