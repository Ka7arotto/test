```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
5 	s32 vps_id;
6 	HEVC_VPS *vps;
10 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
12 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability in the given code is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. The root cause is that the `vps_id` variable is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `hevc->vps` array. The code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, but it does not check if `vps_id` is negative. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `hevc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
>    if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

By adding the condition `(vps_id < 0)` to the `if` statement, the code now checks if `vps_id` is negative or greater than or equal to 16. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns -1, preventing an out-of-bounds read access to the `hevc->vps` array.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```

5 	VVC_VPS *vps;
9 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
10 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
11 	if (!vps_id) {
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 15 `vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];` is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the value of `vps_id` is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `vvc->vps` array.

The code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16 (line 10), but it does not check if `vps_id` is negative. If `vps_id` is negative, it can still cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing `vvc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `vvc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is non-negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being less than 16.

Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
>    if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices (0 to 15, inclusive) for the `vvc->vps` array, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 s32 hevc_parse_slice_segment(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, HEVCSliceInfo *si)
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
7 	s32 pps_id;
31 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
32 	if (pps_id >= 64)
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 35 is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the value of `pps_id` is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `hevc->pps` array. If `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64, it will cause an out-of-bounds read access, leading to undefined behavior or a potential crash.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps_id` is within the valid range for accessing the `hevc->pps` array. The provided patch achieves this by checking if `pps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 64. If either of these conditions is true, it means that `pps_id` is out of the valid range, and the code should handle this case appropriately (e.g., return an error or take appropriate action).

The patch modifies the condition as follows:

```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

By adding the condition `pps_id<0`, the patch ensures that `pps_id` is not only checked for being greater than or equal to 64 but also for being less than 0. This comprehensive check prevents both out-of-bounds read accesses (when `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64) and negative indexing (when `pps_id` is less than 0).

With this patch, the code will properly validate the value of `pps_id` before using it as an index to access the `hevc->pps` array, mitigating the CWE-125 vulnerability.

Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int crypto_report_acomp(struct sk_buff *skb, struct crypto_alg *alg)
3     struct crypto_report_acomp racomp;
4     strlcpy(racomp.type, "acomp", sizeof(racomp.type));```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
4     strlcpy(racomp.type, "acomp", sizeof(racomp.type));
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability in the given code is CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The `strlcpy` function copies the string `"acomp"` into `racomp.type` buffer, but it does not null-terminate the destination buffer if the source string is longer than or equal to the destination buffer size. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read when the `racomp.type` buffer is accessed later, as the buffer may not be properly null-terminated.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the destination buffer is always null-terminated, even if the source string is truncated. The `strncpy` function is a safer alternative to `strlcpy` in this case, as it always null-terminates the destination buffer if the source string is longer than or equal to the destination buffer size.

Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<     strlcpy(racomp.type, "acomp", sizeof(racomp.type));
---
>     strncpy(racomp.type, "acomp", sizeof(racomp.type));
```

By using `strncpy` instead of `strlcpy`, the destination buffer `racomp.type` will always be null-terminated, even if the source string `"acomp"` is longer than or equal to the buffer size. This ensures that any subsequent access to `racomp.type` will not result in an out-of-bounds read.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static __u8 *sp_report_fixup(struct hid_device *hdev, __u8 *rdesc,
2 		unsigned int *rsize)
4 	if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
7 		rdesc[105] = rdesc[110] = 0x03;
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
8 		rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists in the code because the condition `*rsize >= 107` does not guarantee that the buffer `rdesc` has enough space to access the elements `rdesc[110]` and `rdesc[111]` in the line `rdesc[105] = rdesc[110] = 0x03; rdesc[106] = rdesc[111] = 0x21;`. If `*rsize` is less than 112, accessing `rdesc[110]` and `rdesc[111]` will cause an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, we need to ensure that the buffer `rdesc` has enough space to access the elements `rdesc[110]` and `rdesc[111]`. This can be done by modifying the condition to check if `*rsize` is greater than or equal to 112 instead of 107. Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<    if (*rsize >= 107 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
---
>    if (*rsize >= 112 && rdesc[104] == 0x26 && rdesc[105] == 0x80 &&
```

By changing the condition to `*rsize >= 112`, we ensure that the buffer `rdesc` has enough space to access the elements `rdesc[110]` and `rdesc[111]`, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 35 is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the value of `pps_id` is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `hevc->pps` array. If `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64, it will cause an out-of-bounds read access, leading to undefined behavior or a potential crash.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps_id` is within the valid range for accessing the `hevc->pps` array. The provided patch achieves this by checking if `pps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 64. If either of these conditions is true, it means that `pps_id` is out of the valid range, and the code should handle this case appropriately (e.g., return an error or take appropriate action).

The patch modifies the condition as follows:

```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

By adding the condition `pps_id<0`, the patch ensures that `pps_id` is not only checked for being greater than or equal to 64 but also for being less than 0. This comprehensive check prevents both out-of-bounds read accesses (when `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64) and negative indexing (when `pps_id` is less than 0).

With this patch, the code will properly validate the value of `pps_id` before using it as an index to access the `hevc->pps` array, mitigating the CWE-125 vulnerability.
