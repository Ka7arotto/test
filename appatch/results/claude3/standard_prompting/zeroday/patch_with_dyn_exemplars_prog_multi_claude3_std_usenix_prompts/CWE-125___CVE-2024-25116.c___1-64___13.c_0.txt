38 		sps->state = 1;
39 		sps->id = sps_id;
40 		sps->vps_id = vps_id;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
40 		sps->vps_id = vps_id;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists because the value of `vps_id` is not properly validated before being used to access the `hevc->sps` array. Specifically, the code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, but it does not check if `vps_id` is less than 0. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->sps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within a valid range before using it to access the `hevc->sps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) {
---
>    if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) {
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range of 0 to 15 before proceeding with the code that uses `vps_id` to access the `hevc->sps` array. By checking for both negative values and values greater than or equal to 16, the code prevents out-of-bounds reads and mitigates the CWE-125 vulnerability.

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability in the given code is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. The root cause is that the `vps_id` variable is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `hevc->vps` array. The code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, but it does not check if `vps_id` is negative. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `hevc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
>    if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

By adding the condition `(vps_id < 0)` to the `if` statement, the code now checks if `vps_id` is negative or greater than or equal to 16. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns -1, preventing an out-of-bounds read access to the `hevc->vps` array.

15 	vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 15 `vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];` is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the value of `vps_id` is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `vvc->vps` array.

The code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16 (line 10), but it does not check if `vps_id` is negative. If `vps_id` is negative, it can still cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing `vvc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `vvc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is non-negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being less than 16.

Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
>    if ((vps_id<0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices (0 to 15, inclusive) for the `vvc->vps` array, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 15 `vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];` is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the value of `vps_id` is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `vvc->vps` array.

which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
43 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 43 `vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];` is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the value of `vps_id` is not properly checked before being used as an index to access the `hevc->vps` array. The code only checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16 (line 15), but it does not check if `vps_id` is less than 0. If `vps_id` is negative, it can cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `hevc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<   if (vps_id >= 16) {
---
>   if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) {
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is checked for both negative values and values greater than or equal to 16, which are invalid indices for the `hevc->vps` array. By doing this, the code prevents out-of-bounds reads and mitigates the CWE-125 vulnerability.
