Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 s32 hevc_parse_slice_segment(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, HEVCSliceInfo *si)
5 	HEVC_PPS *pps;
7 	s32 pps_id;
31 	pps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "pps_id");
32 	if (pps_id >= 64)
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
35 	pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 35 is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the value of `pps_id` is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `hevc->pps` array. If `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64, it will cause an out-of-bounds read access, leading to undefined behavior or a potential crash.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that `pps_id` is within the valid range for accessing the `hevc->pps` array. The provided patch achieves this by checking if `pps_id` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 64. If either of these conditions is true, it means that `pps_id` is out of the valid range, and the code should handle this case appropriately (e.g., return an error or take appropriate action).

The patch modifies the condition as follows:

```
< 	if (pps_id >= 64)
---
> 	if ((pps_id<0) || (pps_id >= 64))
```

By adding the condition `pps_id<0`, the patch ensures that `pps_id` is not only checked for being greater than or equal to 64 but also for being less than 0. This comprehensive check prevents both out-of-bounds read accesses (when `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64) and negative indexing (when `pps_id` is less than 0).

With this patch, the code will properly validate the value of `pps_id` before using it as an index to access the `hevc->pps` array, mitigating the CWE-125 vulnerability.
