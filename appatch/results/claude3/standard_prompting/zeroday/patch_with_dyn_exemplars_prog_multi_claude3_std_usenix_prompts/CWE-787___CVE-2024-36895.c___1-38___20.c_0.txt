4     struct hid_descriptor *desc;

16     memcpy(input_device->hid_desc, desc, desc->bLength);
17     input_device->report_desc_size = desc->desc[0].wDescriptorLength;
18     input_device->report_desc = kzalloc(input_device->report_desc_size, GFP_ATOMIC);```
which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
18     input_device->report_desc = kzalloc(input_device->report_desc_size, GFP_ATOMIC);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) exists in the code because the value of `input_device->report_desc_size` is directly used as the size argument for `kzalloc` without any validation. If `input_device->report_desc_size` is 0 or a very large value, `kzalloc` may allocate a zero-sized or excessively large buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when the buffer is accessed later.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, we need to ensure that `input_device->report_desc_size` is a valid and reasonable value before calling `kzalloc`. A common strategy is to add a check for the value of `input_device->report_desc_size` and handle the case when it is 0 or an unreasonable value. The patch does this by adding an `if` condition to check if `input_device->report_desc_size` is 0, and if so, it performs a cleanup operation (which is not shown in the provided code snippet). After this check, it is safe to call `kzalloc` with `input_device->report_desc_size` as the size argument.

The reasoning behind the patch is as follows:

1. Check if `input_device->report_desc_size` is 0 or an unreasonable value.
2. If `input_device->report_desc_size` is 0, perform a cleanup operation and exit the function safely.
3. If `input_device->report_desc_size` is a valid value, proceed with the `kzalloc` call to allocate the buffer.

By adding this check, the patch ensures that `kzalloc` is called with a valid and reasonable size argument, preventing the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:

18 		r = card->sm_ctx.ops.read_binary(card, idx, buf, count);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps:

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) exists in the code because the value of `bufsize` is assigned directly from `file->size` without any bounds checking. If `file->size` is larger than the size of the buffer `buf` (2048 bytes), the call to `sc_read_binary` at line 18 will write beyond the bounds of `buf`, causing a buffer overflow.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To prevent the buffer overflow, the value of `bufsize` should be limited to the size of the buffer `buf`. This can be achieved by taking the minimum of `file->size` and `sizeof buf`. Therefore, the patch should be:

```
<    bufsize = file->size;
---
>    bufsize = MIN(file->size, sizeof buf);
```

This way, `bufsize` will be set to the smaller value between `file->size` and `sizeof buf`, ensuring that the call to `sc_read_binary` will not write beyond the bounds of the buffer `buf`.

which has a CWE-787 vulnerability at line:
```
49 			memcpy(&pi, nbuf + doff, descsz);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability in the given code is a CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability. The root cause is that the `memcpy` function at line 49 is copying `descsz` bytes from `nbuf + doff` to the `pi` buffer, which has a fixed size of `sizeof(pi)`. If `descsz` is larger than `sizeof(pi)`, the `memcpy` operation will write beyond the bounds of the `pi` buffer, causing a buffer overflow.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the number of bytes copied by `memcpy` does not exceed the size of the destination buffer `pi`. This can be achieved by using the `MIN` macro to take the minimum value between `descsz` and `sizeof(pi)`. By doing so, we guarantee that the number of bytes copied will never exceed the size of the `pi` buffer, preventing the out-of-bounds write.

The patch should be:

```
<             memcpy(&pi, nbuf + doff, descsz);
---
>             memcpy(&pi, nbuf + doff, MIN(descsz, sizeof(pi)));
```

This patch ensures that the `memcpy` function copies the minimum of `descsz` and `sizeof(pi)` bytes from `nbuf + doff` to the `pi` buffer, effectively preventing the buffer overflow vulnerability.
