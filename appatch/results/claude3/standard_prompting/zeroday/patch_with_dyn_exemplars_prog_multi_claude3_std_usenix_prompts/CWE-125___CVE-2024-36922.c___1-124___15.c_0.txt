```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)
5 	s32 vps_id;

10 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
12 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability in the given code is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. The root cause is that the `vps_id` variable is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `hevc->vps` array. The code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, but it does not check if `vps_id` is negative. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `hevc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
>    if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

By adding the condition `(vps_id < 0)` to the `if` statement, the code now checks if `vps_id` is negative or greater than or equal to 16. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns -1, preventing an out-of-bounds read access to the `hevc->vps` array.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_sps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, u8 layer_id, u32 *vui_flag_pos)
6 	HEVC_VPS *vps;
14 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
15 	if (vps_id >= 16) {
31 	sps_id = gf_bs_read_ue_log(bs, "sps_id");
32 	if ((sps_id < 0) || (sps_id >= 16)) {
43 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
43 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 43 `vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];` is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the value of `vps_id` is not properly checked before being used as an index to access the `hevc->vps` array. The code only checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16 (line 15), but it does not check if `vps_id` is less than 0. If `vps_id` is negative, it can cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `hevc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<   if (vps_id >= 16) {
---
>   if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) {
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is checked for both negative values and values greater than or equal to 16, which are invalid indices for the `hevc->vps` array. By doing this, the code prevents out-of-bounds reads and mitigates the CWE-125 vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static int wm8994_get_retune_mobile_enum(struct snd_kcontrol *kcontrol, struct snd_ctl_elem_value *ucontrol)
3     struct snd_soc_codec *codec = snd_kcontrol_chip(kcontrol);
4     struct wm8994_priv *wm8994 = snd_soc_codec_get_drvdata(codec);
5     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
6     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists in the code because the value of `block` is not checked before being used as an index to access the `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg` array. If `wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block` returns a negative value, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, we need to ensure that `block` is a valid index before using it to access the `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg` array. This can be done by checking if `block` is non-negative before proceeding with the array access. The patch introduces a check for `block < 0` and returns early if the condition is true, preventing the out-of-bounds read. The patch is as follows:

```
<     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
<     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
---
>     int block = wm8994_get_retune_mobile_block(kcontrol->id.name);
>     if (block < 0)
>     {
>         return block;
>     }
>     ucontrol->value.enumerated.item[0] = wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg[block];
```

By adding the check `if (block < 0)` and returning early if the condition is true, the code ensures that `block` is a valid non-negative index before accessing the `wm8994->retune_mobile_cfg` array, preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 void gdImageFillToBorder (gdImagePtr im, int x, int y, int border, int color)
8 	if (border < 0) {
13 	if (!im->trueColor) {
14 		if ((color > (im->colorsTotal - 1)) || (border > (im->colorsTotal - 1)) || (color < 0)) {
20 	im->alphaBlendingFlag = 0;
22 	if (x >= im->sx) {
23 		x = im->sx - 1;
24 	} else if (x < 0) {
25 		x = 0;
27 	if (y >= im->sy) {
28 		y = im->sy - 1;
29 	} else if (y < 0) {
30 		y = 0;
33 	for (i = x; i >= 0; i--) {
34 		if (gdImageGetPixel(im, i, y) == border) {
37 		gdImageSetPixel(im, i, y, color);```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
37 		gdImageSetPixel(im, i, y, color);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists in the code because the function `gdImageGetPixel` is called with the pixel coordinates `i` and `y`, which are not properly validated against the image dimensions `im->sx` and `im->sy`. If `i` or `y` is out of bounds, `gdImageGetPixel` will read from an invalid memory location, causing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

Although the code checks if `x` and `y` are within the image bounds (lines 22-30), it does not check if `i` is within the bounds when calling `gdImageGetPixel(im, i, y)` (line 34). The loop `for (i = x; i >= 0; i--)` (line 33) can potentially make `i` negative, leading to an out-of-bounds read when `gdImageGetPixel` is called.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, we need to ensure that `i` is within the image bounds before calling `gdImageGetPixel`. However, instead of adding a separate check for `i`, the patch takes a different approach by checking if the `color` value is negative or not.

The reasoning behind this patch is that if `color` is negative, it is an invalid color value, and the function `gdImageSetPixel` should not be called with an invalid color. By adding the condition `color < 0` to the existing check `border < 0` (line 8), the function will exit early if either `border` or `color` is negative, effectively preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability from occurring.

While this patch does not directly address the root cause of the vulnerability (the lack of bounds checking for `i`), it provides a workaround by avoiding the vulnerable code path altogether when `color` is invalid. This approach is likely taken because it requires fewer code changes and is easier to implement than adding a separate bounds check for `i`.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static struct phy *serdes_simple_xlate(struct device *dev,
2 				       struct of_phandle_args *args)
4 	struct serdes_ctrl *ctrl = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
5 	unsigned int port, idx, i;
7 	if (args->args_count != 2)
11 	idx = args->args[1];
13 	for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
14 		struct serdes_macro *macro = phy_get_drvdata(ctrl->phys[i]);
16 		if (idx != macro->idx)```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 		struct serdes_macro *macro = phy_get_drvdata(ctrl->phys[i]);
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists in the code because the loop condition `i <= SERDES_MAX` allows the loop index `i` to reach the value `SERDES_MAX`. If `ctrl->phys` is an array of size `SERDES_MAX`, then accessing `ctrl->phys[SERDES_MAX]` will result in an out-of-bounds read, as array indices in C start from 0.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, we need to ensure that the loop index `i` does not exceed the maximum valid index of the `ctrl->phys` array. Since array indices in C start from 0, the maximum valid index for an array of size `SERDES_MAX` is `SERDES_MAX - 1`. Therefore, the patch should change the loop condition from `i <= SERDES_MAX` to `i < SERDES_MAX`, which will prevent the loop from accessing the out-of-bounds element `ctrl->phys[SERDES_MAX]`.

The patch:
```
<    for (i = 0; i <= SERDES_MAX; i++) {
---
>    for (i = 0; i < SERDES_MAX; i++) {
```
ensures that the loop index `i` will never reach the value `SERDES_MAX`, thus avoiding the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.


Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static s32 gf_hevc_read_vps_bs_internal(GF_BitStream *bs, HEVCState *hevc, Bool stop_at_vps_ext)

10 	vps_id = gf_bs_read_int_log(bs, 4, "vps_id");
12 	if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
14 	vps = &hevc->vps[vps_id];
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability in the given code is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. The root cause is that the `vps_id` variable is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `hevc->vps` array. The code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, but it does not check if `vps_id` is negative. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `hevc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) return -1;
---
>    if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) return -1;
```

By adding the condition `(vps_id < 0)` to the `if` statement, the code now checks if `vps_id` is negative or greater than or equal to 16. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns -1, preventing an out-of-bounds read access to the `hevc->vps` array.


Q: Given the following code slice:

40 		sps->vps_id = vps_id;```
which has a CWE-125 vulnerability at line:
```
40 		sps->vps_id = vps_id;
```
Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) exists because the value of `vps_id` is not properly validated before being used to access the `hevc->sps` array. Specifically, the code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16, but it does not check if `vps_id` is less than 0. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `hevc->sps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix the vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within a valid range before using it to access the `hevc->sps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is not negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being greater than or equal to 16. The patch should be:

```
<    if (vps_id >= 16) {
---
>    if ((vps_id < 0) || (vps_id >= 16)) {
```

This patch ensures that `vps_id` is within the valid range of 0 to 15 before proceeding with the code that uses `vps_id` to access the `hevc->sps` array. By checking for both negative values and values greater than or equal to 16, the code prevents out-of-bounds reads and mitigates the CWE-125 vulnerability.

Please generate the patch for the vulnerability. Please follow the patch format in the exemplars.
The patching can be done in two steps.

Step 1. Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability at line 15 `vps = &vvc->vps[vps_id];` is a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability. This is because the value of `vps_id` is not properly validated before being used as an index to access the `vvc->vps` array.

The code checks if `vps_id` is greater than or equal to 16 (line 10), but it does not check if `vps_id` is negative. If `vps_id` is negative, it can still cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing `vvc->vps[vps_id]`.

Step 2. Fixing Strategy: To fix this vulnerability, the code needs to ensure that `vps_id` is within the valid range of indices for the `vvc->vps` array. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `vps_id` is non-negative, in addition to the existing check for `vps_id` being less than 16.

Therefore, the patch should be:

```
