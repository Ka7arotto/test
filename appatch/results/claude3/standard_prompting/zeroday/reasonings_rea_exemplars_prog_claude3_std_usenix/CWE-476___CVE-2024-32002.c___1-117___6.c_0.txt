The given code slice does not actually contain a CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability at the specified line. Let me explain why:

1. Root Cause Analysis:
   The line in question is:
   ```c
   char *sm_alternate = NULL, *error_strategy = NULL;
   ```

   This line is simply declaring two pointers to char and initializing them to NULL. This is a safe practice and does not introduce a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.

2. Misunderstanding:
   It's possible that the question misidentifies this line as vulnerable. Initializing pointers to NULL is actually a good practice because:
   - It clearly indicates that the pointers are not yet pointing to valid memory.
   - It allows for later checks to see if the pointers have been assigned before use.

3. Potential for Vulnerability:
   While this line itself is not vulnerable, it could potentially lead to a CWE-476 vulnerability if these NULL pointers are dereferenced later in the code without first checking if they have been assigned valid memory addresses.

4. Best Practices:
   - Initializing pointers to NULL, as done here, is a good practice.
   - Before using these pointers later in the code, they should be checked for NULL to avoid potential NULL pointer dereferences.

In conclusion, the specified line does not contain a CWE-476 vulnerability. It's a safe initialization of pointers. The vulnerability, if it exists, would be in code that uses these pointers without proper NULL checks, but such code is not present in the given slice.
