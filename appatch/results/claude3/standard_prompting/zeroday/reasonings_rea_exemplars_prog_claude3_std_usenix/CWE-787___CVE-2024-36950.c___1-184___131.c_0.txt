The vulnerability at line 131 is not actually a CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability. The given code snippet does not show any clear indication of an out-of-bounds write occurring at this line. 

The line in question:
```c
131 	reg_write(ohci, OHCI1394_IntEventClear, OHCI1394_busReset);
```

This line appears to be a normal register write operation, which is common in device driver code. It's writing to a specific register (OHCI1394_IntEventClear) with a specific value (OHCI1394_busReset). This operation is typically used to clear an interrupt flag after processing a bus reset event.

Without more context or information about the `reg_write` function implementation or the specific hardware being programmed, it's not possible to definitively state that this line contains a CWE-787 vulnerability.

If there is indeed a vulnerability here, it would more likely be related to:

1. Incorrect register address: If OHCI1394_IntEventClear is not the correct address for this operation.
2. Incorrect value: If OHCI1394_busReset is not the correct value to write for this operation.
3. Timing issues: If this write is performed at an inappropriate time in the bus reset sequence.
4. Lack of error checking: If the function doesn't verify that the write operation succeeded.

However, none of these potential issues directly relate to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).

To properly identify and analyze vulnerabilities, it's crucial to have a complete understanding of the codebase, the hardware being programmed, and the specific requirements and constraints of the system. Without this context, it's challenging to accurately determine the presence or nature of vulnerabilities in isolated code snippets.
