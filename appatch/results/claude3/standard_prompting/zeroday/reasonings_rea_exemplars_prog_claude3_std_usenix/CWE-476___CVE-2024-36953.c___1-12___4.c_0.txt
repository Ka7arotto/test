I apologize, but there appears to be a misunderstanding in your question. The code snippet you've provided does not contain a CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability at the line you've indicated. Let me explain why:

1. The line `int cpuid;` is simply a variable declaration. It's declaring an integer variable named `cpuid`. This declaration by itself does not involve any pointer operations or potential NULL pointer dereferences.

2. CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) occurs when a program dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is actually NULL. This typically happens when using pointers without proper initialization or validation.

3. The provided code snippet is incomplete and doesn't show any pointer usage or dereferencing operations.

Given the limited information in the provided code, there isn't a clear CWE-476 vulnerability present. To have such a vulnerability, we would need to see code that actually uses pointers and potentially dereferences them without proper checks.

If there is additional context or code that you haven't included, please provide it, as it might contain the actual vulnerability you're referring to. Without more information, it's not possible to analyze the root cause of a CWE-476 vulnerability in this specific code snippet.
