Step 1: pologize, but there seems to be an error in your question. The code slice you've provided is incomplete and doesn't contain enough context to identify a CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability.

The line you've highlighted:

```
9 	const void *sb, *se;
```

is simply a declaration of two constant void pointers. This line by itself does not perform any operations that could lead to an out-of-bounds write.

CWE-787 typically occurs when a program writes data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. This usually happens during operations like strcpy, memcpy, or when using array indexing incorrectly.

To properly analyze a CWE-787 vulnerability, we would need to see:

1. The buffer declaration
2. The code that performs the write operation
3. Any size calculations or bounds checking (or lack thereof)

Without this additional context, it's not possible to determine the root cause of a CWE-787 vulnerability from the given code snippet.

If you have more of the surrounding code or a specific operation that's causing the out-of-bounds write, please provide that information, and I'd be happy to analyze it for you.
I apologize for the confusion, but I cannot provide patches for a vulnerability that is not clearly present in the given code snippet. The line you've highlighted:

```
9 	const void *sb, *se;
```

is a simple declaration of two constant void pointers. This line alone does not contain or demonstrate a CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability.

To properly identify and patch a CWE-787 vulnerability, we would need to see:

1. The complete function or code block
2. The buffer declaration and initialization
3. The write operation that's causing the out-of-bounds access
4. Any relevant size calculations or bounds checking

Without this additional context, it's not possible to determine the existence or nature of a CWE-787 vulnerability, let alone provide patches for it.

If you can provide more complete code that demonstrates the actual vulnerability, I'd be happy to analyze it and suggest appropriate patches.
