The root cause of the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability at line 108 is not directly evident from the provided code snippet. However, I can explain why this line might be flagged for a potential integer overflow:

1. The function `qca_generate_hsp_nvm_name` is called with `sizeof(config.fwname)` as one of its arguments. This size is likely used within the function to prevent buffer overflow when generating the filename.

2. The vulnerability could occur if the `qca_generate_hsp_nvm_name` function doesn't properly handle the size parameter, potentially allowing an integer overflow when calculating buffer sizes or offsets internally.

3. Integer overflows in such contexts can lead to buffer overflows if the overflowed value is used to control buffer access or allocation.

4. The use of `ver`, `rom_ver`, and `boardid` as parameters could also contribute to the issue if these values are used in calculations that might overflow.

To properly assess and fix this vulnerability, we would need to:

1. Examine the implementation of `qca_generate_hsp_nvm_name` to ensure it properly handles the size parameter and doesn't perform unsafe integer arithmetic.

2. Verify that the values of `ver`, `rom_ver`, and `boardid` are within expected ranges and won't cause overflows when used in calculations.

3. Consider using safer alternatives like `snprintf` with proper size checking, or use bounded string manipulation functions to prevent potential overflows.

4. Implement additional bounds checking and input validation to ensure that all parameters are within safe ranges before they're used in potentially vulnerable operations.

Without seeing the implementation of `qca_generate_hsp_nvm_name`, it's difficult to provide a more specific analysis or solution. The key is to ensure all integer arithmetic is performed safely, with proper bounds checking and overflow prevention.
