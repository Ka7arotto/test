Let's analyze the code step by step to identify the potential CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability:

1. Input analysis:
   - The function receives `pSrcData` (a byte pointer) and `SrcSize` (a 32-bit unsigned integer) as inputs.

2. Stream initialization (line 7):
   - A static stream `stream` is initialized using `Stream_StaticConstInit()`.
   - It uses `pSrcData` as the buffer and `SrcSize` as the buffer size.

3. Potential vulnerability:
   - The vulnerability lies in trusting the `SrcSize` parameter without validation.
   - If `SrcSize` is larger than the actual allocated size of `pSrcData`, it could lead to an out-of-bounds access.

4. Consequences:
   - Subsequent operations on `stream` (like `Stream_Read_UINT8`, `Stream_Read_UINT16`, etc.) might access memory beyond the bounds of `pSrcData`.
   - This could result in reading or writing to unintended memory locations, potentially causing buffer overflows or information leaks.

5. Root cause:
   - The code assumes that `SrcSize` accurately represents the size of the buffer pointed to by `pSrcData`.
   - There's no validation to ensure that `SrcSize` doesn't exceed the actual allocated size of `pSrcData`.

Conclusion:
The vulnerability (CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write) occurs because the code trusts the `SrcSize` parameter without verifying if it accurately represents the size of the `pSrcData` buffer. If an attacker can control `SrcSize`, they could potentially cause the program to read or write beyond the bounds of the allocated memory, leading to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues. To mitigate this, the function should validate `SrcSize` against the actual size of the allocated `pSrcData` buffer before using it to initialize the stream.
