I apologize, but there appears to be an error in the question. The line you've highlighted:

```
112 	spin_lock_irq(&ohci->lock);
```

does not exhibit a CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability. This line is a standard synchronization primitive used to acquire a spinlock, which is a common practice in concurrent programming to protect shared resources.

CWE-787 typically involves writing data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. The `spin_lock_irq()` function call doesn't involve any buffer operations, so it cannot cause an out-of-bounds write.

Given the information provided, there doesn't appear to be a clear CWE-787 vulnerability in the highlighted line or its immediate context. If there is indeed a vulnerability in this code, it would likely be in a different part of the function or related to other operations not shown in the given snippet.

To properly analyze for CWE-787, we would need to examine parts of the code that involve buffer operations, array indexing, or pointer arithmetic. Without such context, it's not possible to identify an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the given line.
