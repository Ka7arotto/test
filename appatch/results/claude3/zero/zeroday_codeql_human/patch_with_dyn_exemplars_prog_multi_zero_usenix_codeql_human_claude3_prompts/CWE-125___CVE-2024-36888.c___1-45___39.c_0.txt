Q: Given the following code slice:
```
1 static bool kick_pool(struct worker_pool *pool)
2 {
3 	struct worker *worker = first_idle_worker(pool);
4 	struct task_struct *p;
5 
6 	lockdep_assert_held(&pool->lock);
7 
8 	if (!need_more_worker(pool) || !worker)
9 		return false;
10 
11 	if (pool->flags & POOL_BH) {
12 		kick_bh_pool(pool);
13 		return true;
14 	}
15 
16 	p = worker->task;
17 
18 #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
19 	/*
20 	 * Idle @worker is about to execute @work and waking up provides an
21 	 * opportunity to migrate @worker at a lower cost by setting the task's
22 	 * wake_cpu field. Let's see if we want to move @worker to improve
23 	 * execution locality.
24 	 *
25 	 * We're waking the worker that went idle the latest and there's some
26 	 * chance that @worker is marked idle but hasn't gone off CPU yet. If
27 	 * so, setting the wake_cpu won't do anything. As this is a best-effort
28 	 * optimization and the race window is narrow, let's leave as-is for
29 	 * now. If this becomes pronounced, we can skip over workers which are
30 	 * still on cpu when picking an idle worker.
31 	 *
32 	 * If @pool has non-strict affinity, @worker might have ended up outside
33 	 * its affinity scope. Repatriate.
34 	 */
35 	if (!pool->attrs->affn_strict &&
36 	    !cpumask_test_cpu(p->wake_cpu, pool->attrs->__pod_cpumask)) {
37 		struct work_struct *work = list_first_entry(&pool->worklist,
38 						struct work_struct, entry);
39 		p->wake_cpu = cpumask_any_distribute(pool->attrs->__pod_cpumask);
40 		get_work_pwq(work)->stats[PWQ_STAT_REPATRIATED]++;
41 	}
42 #endif
43 	wake_up_process(p);
44 	return true;
45 }
```
which has a vulnerability among CWE-125 and among lines:
```
6 	lockdep_assert_held(&pool->lock);
```
Please generate five possible patches for the vulnerability.
