I apologize, but there appears to be a misunderstanding in your question. The line you've highlighted:

```
112 	spin_lock_irq(&ohci->lock);
```

does not contain a vulnerability related to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). This line is actually a standard synchronization mechanism in kernel programming to prevent race conditions. It's not writing data to any buffer or performing any operation that could lead to an out-of-bounds write.

CWE-787 typically occurs when a program writes data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. The `spin_lock_irq()` function call doesn't involve any buffer operations.

Without a clear vulnerability present in the given code snippet, I cannot provide meaningful patches. If you believe there's a specific vulnerability elsewhere in the code, please provide more details about where you think the out-of-bounds write might be occurring.

If you have a different concern about this line or a different part of the code, please clarify, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
