I apologize, but I don't see a clear Use-After-Free (CWE-401) vulnerability in the line you've highlighted or in the surrounding code. The line:

```c
args.ignore_crossmnt = (ignore_crossmnt != 0);
```

is simply assigning a boolean value to a struct member based on the input parameter. This operation doesn't involve any memory allocation, deallocation, or potential use after free.

Without a clear vulnerability present, I cannot provide meaningful patches. However, I can offer some general advice for improving code safety:

1. Ensure all pointers are properly initialized before use.
2. Use appropriate memory management techniques, such as reference counting or garbage collection.
3. Validate input parameters before using them.
4. Use static analysis tools to detect potential memory issues.
5. Consider using safer alternatives to raw pointers, such as smart pointers in C++.

If you have additional context or if you've identified a specific issue elsewhere in the code, please provide more details so I can offer more targeted assistance.
