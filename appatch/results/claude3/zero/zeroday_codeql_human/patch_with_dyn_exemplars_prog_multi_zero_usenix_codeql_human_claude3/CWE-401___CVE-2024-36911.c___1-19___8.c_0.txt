I apologize, but I cannot generate patches for the given code slice because there is no clear Use-After-Free (CWE-401) vulnerability in the line you specified:

```
8 	vfree(nvdev->recv_buf);
```

This line is simply freeing memory allocated for `nvdev->recv_buf` using the `vfree()` function, which is the correct way to free memory allocated with `vmalloc()`. There's no evident use of this pointer after it has been freed in the provided code snippet.

A Use-After-Free vulnerability typically occurs when a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed. In this case, we don't see any subsequent use of `nvdev->recv_buf` after the `vfree()` call.

Without more context or a clear demonstration of how this memory is being accessed after being freed, it's not possible to identify a CWE-401 vulnerability or propose meaningful patches.

If there's additional code or context that shows a use of `nvdev->recv_buf` after this `vfree()` call, please provide that information, and I'd be happy to assist in analyzing the vulnerability and suggesting potential patches.
