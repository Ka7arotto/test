I apologize, but I cannot identify a clear vulnerability related to CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) in the line you specified:

```
5 	struct qxl_release *release;
```

This line is simply declaring a pointer to a struct qxl_release. It does not involve any array access or memory operations that could lead to an out-of-bounds read.

CWE-125 typically occurs when a program reads data past the end of the intended buffer. The line you've highlighted doesn't perform any read operations, so it's not possible to generate patches for a non-existent vulnerability here.

If there's a specific concern or context you're worried about regarding this line, please provide more details. Otherwise, I cannot suggest patches for a vulnerability that isn't present in the given code snippet.
