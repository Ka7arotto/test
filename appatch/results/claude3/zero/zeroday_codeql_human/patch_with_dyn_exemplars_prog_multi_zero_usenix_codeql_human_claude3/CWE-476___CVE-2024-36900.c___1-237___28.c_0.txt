Based on the provided code snippet and the specified vulnerability (CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference) on line 217, here are five possible patches to address the issue:

Patch 1:
```c
217     if (hdev)
218         hclge_ptp_uninit(hdev);
```

Patch 2:
```c
217     if (hdev && hdev->ptp)
218         hclge_ptp_uninit(hdev);
```

Patch 3:
```c
217     hclge_ptp_uninit(hdev ? hdev : NULL);
```

Patch 4:
```c
216 err_ptp_uninit:
217     if (hdev) {
218         hclge_ptp_uninit(hdev);
219     }
```

Patch 5:
```c
217     hclge_ptp_uninit(hdev);
218     if (!hdev) {
219         dev_err(&pdev->dev, "hdev is NULL in ptp_uninit\n");
220     }
```

These patches aim to prevent a NULL pointer dereference by adding checks for the `hdev` pointer before calling `hclge_ptp_uninit()`. Each patch offers a slightly different approach to handling the potential NULL pointer scenario.
