I apologize, but there appears to be a misunderstanding in your question. The line you've highlighted:

```
49 		spin_lock_init(&mem->lock);
```

does not contain a vulnerability related to CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). This line is initializing a spin lock, which is a standard synchronization primitive in kernel programming. It doesn't involve any array or buffer access that could lead to an out-of-bounds read.

CWE-125 typically occurs when a program reads data past the end of the intended buffer. The line you've pointed out doesn't involve any buffer reading operations.

Given that there isn't a CWE-125 vulnerability in the specified line, I cannot provide patches for a non-existent issue. If you believe there's a different vulnerability or if you meant to ask about a different line of code, please clarify your question, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
