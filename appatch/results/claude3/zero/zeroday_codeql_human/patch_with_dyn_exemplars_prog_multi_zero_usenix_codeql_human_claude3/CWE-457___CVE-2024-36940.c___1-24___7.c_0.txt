I apologize, but there appears to be a misunderstanding in the question. The line you've highlighted:

```
8 			error);
```

is part of an error message printing statement and does not contain a CWE-457  vulnerability. This line is simply passing the `error` variable to a `dev_err()` function for logging purposes.

CWE-457 vulnerabilities typically occur when a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed. In the given code snippet, there's no evidence of such behavior on the specified line or in its immediate context.

Without a clear use-after-free scenario in the provided code, it's not possible to generate meaningful patches for a CWE-457 vulnerability. If there's additional context or if you meant to refer to a different part of the code, please provide more information so I can assist you better.

If you have a specific concern about this code that you'd like addressed, or if you meant to ask about a different type of vulnerability, please clarify and I'll be happy to help.
