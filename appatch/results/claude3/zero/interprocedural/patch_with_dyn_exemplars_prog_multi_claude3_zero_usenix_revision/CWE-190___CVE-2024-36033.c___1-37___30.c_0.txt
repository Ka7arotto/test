I apologize, but there is no clear CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability at line 108 in the provided code snippet. The line you mentioned is calling a function `qca_generate_hsp_nvm_name()` with several parameters, including `sizeof(config.fwname)`. This is actually a good practice to prevent buffer overflows by specifying the size of the destination buffer.

Without more context about the `qca_generate_hsp_nvm_name()` function or evidence of an integer overflow, it's not possible to confirm a CWE-190 vulnerability or suggest patches for it.

However, if you're concerned about potential integer overflows in general, here are some general suggestions that could be applied to improve integer handling in C code:

1. Use size-specific integer types:
   ```c
   #include <stdint.h>
   uint16_t boardid = 0;
   ```

2. Check for potential overflows before operations:
   ```c
   if (a > INT_MAX - b) {
       // Handle potential overflow
   } else {
       int result = a + b;
   }
   ```

3. Use safe arithmetic functions:
   ```c
   #include <limits.h>
   long long result;
   if (__builtin_saddll_overflow(a, b, &result)) {
       // Handle overflow
   }
   ```

4. Use wider integer types for intermediate calculations:
   ```c
   uint64_t temp = (uint64_t)a * b;
   if (temp > UINT32_MAX) {
       // Handle overflow
   }
   uint32_t result = (uint32_t)temp;
   ```

5. Validate input values:
   ```c
   if (input > MAX_SAFE_VALUE) {
       // Handle invalid input
   }
   ```

These are general strategies to prevent integer overflows, but without a clear vulnerability in the provided code, it's not possible to provide specific patches for this particular case.
