Here are five possible patches for the CWE-476 vulnerability at line 26:

Patch 1:
```c
if (!eflags || (line && READ_ONCE(line->sw_debounced)))
```

Patch 2:
```c
if (!eflags || (line != NULL && READ_ONCE(line->sw_debounced)))
```

Patch 3:
```c
if (!eflags || (line && line->sw_debounced))
```

Patch 4:
```c
if (!line || !eflags || READ_ONCE(line->sw_debounced))
```

Patch 5:
```c
if (!eflags)
    return 0;
if (line && READ_ONCE(line->sw_debounced))
    return 0;
```

These patches aim to prevent a null pointer dereference by checking if the 'line' pointer is valid before accessing its members. Each patch takes a slightly different approach, but they all serve to mitigate the potential vulnerability.
