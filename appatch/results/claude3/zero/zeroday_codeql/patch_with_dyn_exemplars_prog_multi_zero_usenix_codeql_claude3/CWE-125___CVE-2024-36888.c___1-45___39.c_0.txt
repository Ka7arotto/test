I apologize, but there appears to be a misunderstanding in your question. The line you've highlighted:

```
6 	lockdep_assert_held(&pool->lock);
```

does not contain a CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability. This line is actually a safety check using the `lockdep_assert_held()` macro, which is used to ensure that a particular lock is held at this point in the code. It's a debugging aid and doesn't introduce a NULL pointer dereference risk.

CWE-476 would typically involve dereferencing a pointer without first checking if it's NULL. The given line doesn't dereference any pointers directly.

Given this, I cannot provide patches for a vulnerability that doesn't exist in the specified line. If you believe there's a vulnerability elsewhere in the code, or if you're concerned about a different type of issue, please provide more specific information about the problem you're trying to address.
