I apologize, but there appears to be a misunderstanding in the question. The line you've highlighted:

```
5 	lockdep_assert_held(&mvm->mutex);
```

does not contain a vulnerability related to CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference). This line is actually a debugging assertion used in the Linux kernel to ensure that a particular mutex is held when this function is called. It's a safety check, not a vulnerability.

CWE-476 typically occurs when a program dereferences a pointer that it assumes to be valid, but which may actually be NULL. The given code snippet doesn't show any obvious NULL pointer dereferences.

Given this, I cannot provide patches for a non-existent vulnerability in this line. If there were a real NULL pointer dereference issue elsewhere in the code, we could discuss potential fixes. However, for the given code and the specified line, no patches are necessary or applicable.

If you have concerns about a different part of the code or a different type of vulnerability, please provide more specific information, and I'd be happy to assist you further.
