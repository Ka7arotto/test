Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for the `path` buffer, but the size of the buffer (`len`) is not checked for validity or overflow conditions.

If the `get_kobj_path_length` function returns an incorrect or malicious value for `len`, the `kmalloc` function will allocate memory based on that value. If `len` is too large, it can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when the `fill_kobj_path` function tries to write data into the `path` buffer, which is CWE-787.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the value of `len` before using it to allocate memory, ensuring that it falls within a reasonable range and does not overflow.
