The provided code snippet does not contain enough information to determine the root cause of a CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability at line 8 (`int t;`). This line simply declares an integer variable `t`, which does not directly contribute to an integer overflow or wraparound vulnerability.

Without additional context or function definitions, it is difficult to analyze the root cause of the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is related to the `t` variable, it might be due to an operation involving `t` that could lead to an integer overflow or wraparound, but the provided code does not show such an operation.
