Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `i` is decremented at line 22 without any bounds checking. If `i` becomes negative, the line `byte[i] &= 0x7f;` will result in an out-of-bounds read access to the `byte` array, which is CWE-125.
