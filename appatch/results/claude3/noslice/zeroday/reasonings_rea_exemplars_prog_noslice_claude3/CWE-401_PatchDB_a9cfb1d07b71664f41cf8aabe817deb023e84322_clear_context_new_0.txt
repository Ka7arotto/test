Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because if the `nsc_context_new()` function fails and returns NULL, the memory allocated for `clear` using `calloc` at line 4 is not being freed before the function returns at line 12. This can lead to a memory leak as the allocated memory is not released after its effective lifetime.
