Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the value of `ucontrol->value.integer.value[0]` is assigned to the `int` type variable `anc_active` without any bounds checking. If the value of `ucontrol->value.integer.value[0]` is outside the range of the `int` type, it can lead to an integer overflow or wraparound, resulting in undefined behavior or potential security vulnerabilities.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should perform proper bounds checking on the value of `ucontrol->value.integer.value[0]` before assigning it to `anc_active`. Additionally, if the value is expected to be within a specific range (e.g., 0 or 1), the code should explicitly check for that range and return an appropriate error code if the value is out of range.
