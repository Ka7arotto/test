Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `cc->tfms_count` variable is not validated or checked for a valid range before allocating memory using `kmalloc`. If `cc->tfms_count` is a large value or a negative value, the multiplication operation `cc->tfms_count * sizeof(crypto_skcipher *)` can result in an integer overflow or underflow, leading to an incorrect allocation size. This can cause a buffer overflow or underflow when writing to the allocated memory, resulting in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the value of `cc->tfms_count` to ensure it is within a safe range before performing the memory allocation.
