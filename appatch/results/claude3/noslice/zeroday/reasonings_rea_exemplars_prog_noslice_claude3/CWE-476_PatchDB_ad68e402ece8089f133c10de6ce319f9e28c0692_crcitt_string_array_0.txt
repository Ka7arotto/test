Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `src` array is being accessed without checking if it is NULL or if the individual elements (`src[i]`) are NULL. If `src` or any of its elements (`src[i]`) are NULL, then accessing `src[i].s` at line 12 will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
