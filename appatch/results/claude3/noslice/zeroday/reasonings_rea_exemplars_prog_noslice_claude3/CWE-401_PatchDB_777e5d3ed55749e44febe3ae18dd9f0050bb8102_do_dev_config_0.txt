Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the memory allocated for `bdev` using `kmalloc` at line 47 is not being freed in case of an error condition at line 62. If the `krealloc` call at line 57 fails, the previously allocated memory for `bdev` is not released, leading to a memory leak.
