Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the `scheme` variable is allocated memory using `g_uri_parse_scheme` at line 24, but there is no corresponding `g_free` call to release the memory allocated for `scheme` before the function returns at line 40. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not released after its effective lifetime.
