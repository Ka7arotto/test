Root Cause Analysis: The CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `unichar` is declared as a `long` type, which is a signed integer type. If the value returned by `raptor_utf8_to_unicode_char` is a large positive value that exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `long` type, it may result in an integer overflow or wraparound, leading to undefined behavior or potential security vulnerabilities.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use an unsigned integer type or a larger integer type (e.g., `unsigned long long`) to store the Unicode character value, ensuring that it can accommodate the full range of possible values without overflowing.
