The given code snippet does not seem to have a CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability. The code is responsible for removing or cleaning up resources associated with a platform device.

At line 3, it retrieves a `ds2760_device_info` structure from the platform device data. Then, it cancels two delayed workqueue items (lines 4 and 5) and destroys the workqueue itself (line 6). Finally, it unregisters a power supply (line 7) before returning from the function.

There is no explicit memory allocation or dynamic memory management in this code snippet, so there is no apparent memory leak or missing release of memory after its effective lifetime.

Unless there are additional details or context missing, the provided code does not exhibit a CWE-401 vulnerability based on the information given.
