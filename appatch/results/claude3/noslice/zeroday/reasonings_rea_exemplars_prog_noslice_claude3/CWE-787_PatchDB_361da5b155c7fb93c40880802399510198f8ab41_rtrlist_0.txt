Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the value of `l` is obtained from a `sysctl` call without any validation or bounds checking. If the `sysctl` call returns an unexpectedly large value for `l`, the subsequent `malloc` call at line 13 will allocate a buffer of that size without any checks. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when the code tries to write data to the buffer beyond its allocated size, which is CWE-787.
