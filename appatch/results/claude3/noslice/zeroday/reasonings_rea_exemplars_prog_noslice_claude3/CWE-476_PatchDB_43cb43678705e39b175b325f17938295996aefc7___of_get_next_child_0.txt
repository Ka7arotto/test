Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `prev` pointer is being dereferenced to access `prev->sibling` without first checking if `prev` is NULL. If `prev` is NULL, dereferencing it will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
