Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `put_user` function is used to write the value of `len` to the user-space memory location pointed to by `optlen`. However, there is no check to ensure that `optlen` points to a valid user-space memory address. If `optlen` points to an invalid or unauthorized memory location, the `put_user` function can potentially write data outside the intended memory boundaries, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
