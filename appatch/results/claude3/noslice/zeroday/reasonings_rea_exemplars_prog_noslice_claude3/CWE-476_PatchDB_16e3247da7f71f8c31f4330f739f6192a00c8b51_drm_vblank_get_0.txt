Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `dev` pointer is being dereferenced to access `dev->num_crtcs` without first checking if `dev` is NULL. If `dev` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `num_crtcs` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
