I do not see any obvious CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability in the given code snippet. The line `int ret;` is simply a variable declaration and does not introduce any integer overflow or wraparound vulnerability by itself.

The vulnerability may exist elsewhere in the code, but based on the provided information, I cannot identify the root cause of the CWE-190 vulnerability. If there are any function calls or operations involving integer arithmetic that could potentially lead to an overflow or wraparound, please provide more context or the relevant code snippets.
