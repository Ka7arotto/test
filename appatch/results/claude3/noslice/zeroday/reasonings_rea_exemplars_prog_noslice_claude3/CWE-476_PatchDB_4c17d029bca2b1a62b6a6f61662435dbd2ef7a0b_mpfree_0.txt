Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `mp[part]` pointer is being passed to `free` without first checking if it is NULL. If `mp[part]` is NULL, calling `free` on it will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.

The code should first check if `mp[part]` is not NULL before calling `free(mp[part])`.
