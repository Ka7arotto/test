Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `rv` pointer is being dereferenced to access its `type` field without first checking if `rv` is NULL. If `rv` is NULL, dereferencing it to access `rv->type` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
