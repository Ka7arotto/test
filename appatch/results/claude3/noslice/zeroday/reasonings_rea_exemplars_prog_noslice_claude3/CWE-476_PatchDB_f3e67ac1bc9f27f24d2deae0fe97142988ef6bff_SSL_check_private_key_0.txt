Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because it is dereferencing `ssl->cert->key` without first checking if `ssl->cert` or `ssl->cert->key` is NULL. If either of these pointers is NULL, accessing `ssl->cert->key->x509` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.

The code should first check if `ssl->cert` and `ssl->cert->key` are not NULL before accessing `ssl->cert->key->x509`. A proper null check should be added before line 8 to prevent the NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.
