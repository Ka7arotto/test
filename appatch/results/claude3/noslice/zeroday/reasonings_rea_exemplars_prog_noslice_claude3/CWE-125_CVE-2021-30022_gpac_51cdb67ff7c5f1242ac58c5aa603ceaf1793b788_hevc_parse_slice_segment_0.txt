Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `pps_id` is used to access the `hevc->pps` array without proper bounds checking. The code checks if `pps_id` is greater than or equal to 64 (line 32), but it does not check if `pps_id` is negative. If `pps_id` is negative, it will lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.
