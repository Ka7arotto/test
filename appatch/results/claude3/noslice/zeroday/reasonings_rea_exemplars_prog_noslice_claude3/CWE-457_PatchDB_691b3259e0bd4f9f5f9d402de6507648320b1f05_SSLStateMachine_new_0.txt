The root cause of the CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable) vulnerability in the given code is that the `pMachine` variable is not properly initialized before being used. Specifically, the line:

```
6     pMachine->pCtx = SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_server_method());
```

accesses the `pCtx` member of the `pMachine` struct, which has not been initialized to a valid memory location. This can lead to undefined behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

The code should initialize the `pMachine` variable to a valid memory location before accessing its members. This can be done by either dynamically allocating memory for the struct or ensuring that it is properly initialized before being used.
