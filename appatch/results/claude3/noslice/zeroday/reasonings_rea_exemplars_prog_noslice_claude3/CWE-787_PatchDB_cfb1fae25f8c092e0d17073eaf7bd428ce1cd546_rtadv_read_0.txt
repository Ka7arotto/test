Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `rtadv_recv_packet` function is called with a buffer size of `BUFSIZ`, which is a macro that may not be defined or may be defined to a value that is too small to hold the received packet.

If `BUFSIZ` is smaller than the size of the received packet, the `rtadv_recv_packet` function may write beyond the bounds of the `buf` array, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use a buffer size that is large enough to hold the maximum possible size of the received packet, or it should dynamically allocate memory based on the actual size of the received packet.
