Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the value of `cipher_len - 2` is assigned to `*out_len` without checking if it is a valid value. If `cipher_len` is less than 2, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when accessing the `out` buffer.
