The root cause of the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability in the given code is that the `signal` variable, which is allocated memory using `g_strconcat` at line 5, is not being freed or released before the function returns at line 7.

The `g_strconcat` function is likely part of the GLib library and is used to concatenate strings. It dynamically allocates memory for the resulting concatenated string. However, in this code snippet, there is no corresponding call to free or release the memory allocated for `signal` before the function exits.

This can lead to a memory leak, as the allocated memory for `signal` will not be available for reuse or reclamation by the system. If this function is called repeatedly or in a long-running process, the accumulated memory leaks can potentially lead to resource exhaustion and performance degradation.

To fix this vulnerability, the code should include a call to the appropriate memory release function (likely provided by the GLib library) to free the memory allocated for `signal` before the function returns. Alternatively, the `signal` variable could be declared with a smaller scope, and the memory release could be handled within that scope.
