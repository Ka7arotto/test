The provided code snippet does not contain a CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability at line 4. The line `if (a == b)` is checking if the pointers `a` and `b` are pointing to the same memory location. If they are the same, the function returns `MP_OKAY` without performing any copy operation, as it would be redundant.

This check is a valid optimization and does not lead to a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. The vulnerability might exist elsewhere in the code, but the provided code snippet does not contain enough information to identify it.
