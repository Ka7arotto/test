Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `last_alive` is declared as `cfs_time_t`, which may be a signed integer type. If the value returned by the `lnd_query` function is a large positive value, assigning it to a signed integer type may result in an integer overflow, leading to undefined behavior. This can potentially cause unexpected results or security vulnerabilities.
