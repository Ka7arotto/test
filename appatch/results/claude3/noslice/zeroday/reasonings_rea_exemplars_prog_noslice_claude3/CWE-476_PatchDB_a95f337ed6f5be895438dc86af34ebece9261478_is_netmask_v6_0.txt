Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `ip_strv6` pointer is being passed to the `strchr` function without being checked for NULL. If `ip_strv6` is NULL, the `strchr` function will dereference a NULL pointer, resulting in a crash or undefined behavior.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should check if `ip_strv6` is not NULL before calling `strchr` on it.
