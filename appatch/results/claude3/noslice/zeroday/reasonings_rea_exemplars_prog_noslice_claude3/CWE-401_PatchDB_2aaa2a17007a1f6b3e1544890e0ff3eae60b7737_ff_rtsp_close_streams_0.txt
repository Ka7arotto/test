The given code does not seem to have a CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability at line 16. The code is properly freeing the memory allocated for various resources before the function returns.

At line 18, it frees the memory allocated for `rt->rtsp_streams` using `av_free`.
At line 24, it frees the memory allocated for `rt->p` using `av_free`.
At line 25, it frees the memory allocated for `rt->recvbuf` using `av_free`.

Without more context or function definitions, I cannot identify any memory leak or missing release of memory in the provided code snippet.
