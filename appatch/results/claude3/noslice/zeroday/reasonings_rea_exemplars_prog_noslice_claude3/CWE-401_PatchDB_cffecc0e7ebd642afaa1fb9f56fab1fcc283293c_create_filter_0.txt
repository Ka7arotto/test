The given code does not appear to have a CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability at line 34. The code is properly handling the allocated memory and returning appropriate error codes without any apparent memory leaks.

At line 14, the `avfilter_graph_alloc_filter` function is used to allocate memory for the `AVFilterContext` structure, which is a part of the FFmpeg library's filter graph management. This memory is expected to be managed by the FFmpeg library itself, and the developer does not need to explicitly free it.

The `tmp_args` array on line 5 is a local variable on the stack, and its memory is automatically released when the function returns.

Unless there are any custom memory allocation functions or data structures involved that are not shown in the provided code, there does not seem to be a CWE-401 vulnerability present.
