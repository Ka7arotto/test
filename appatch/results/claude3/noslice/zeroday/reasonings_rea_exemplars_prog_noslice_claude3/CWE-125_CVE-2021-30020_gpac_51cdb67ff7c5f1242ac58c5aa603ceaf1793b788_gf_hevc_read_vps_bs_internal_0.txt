Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability exists in the code because the index `vps_id` is used to access the `hevc->vps` array without proper bounds checking. Although there is a check at line 12 to ensure that `vps_id` is less than 16, there is no check to ensure that `vps_id` is non-negative. If `vps_id` is negative, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which is CWE-125.
