Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `length` parameter passed to `dma_alloc_coherent` is not validated or checked for any upper bound. If an attacker can control the value of `length`, they can potentially cause a buffer overflow by allocating a large amount of memory, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate or impose an upper bound on the `length` parameter before calling `dma_alloc_coherent` to ensure that it does not exceed a safe limit.
