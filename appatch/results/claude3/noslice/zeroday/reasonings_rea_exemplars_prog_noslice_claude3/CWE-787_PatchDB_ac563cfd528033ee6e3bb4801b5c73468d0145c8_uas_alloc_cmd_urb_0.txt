Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `len` variable is used to allocate memory for the `iu` buffer without proper bounds checking.

The `len` variable is calculated based on the `cmnd->cmd_len` value, which is not validated or checked for any upper bound. If an attacker can control the `cmnd->cmd_len` value and make it large enough, the `len` variable can become large, leading to a buffer overflow when `kmalloc` allocates memory for `iu` using `sizeof(*iu) + len`.

This can result in writing data beyond the allocated buffer boundaries, causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
