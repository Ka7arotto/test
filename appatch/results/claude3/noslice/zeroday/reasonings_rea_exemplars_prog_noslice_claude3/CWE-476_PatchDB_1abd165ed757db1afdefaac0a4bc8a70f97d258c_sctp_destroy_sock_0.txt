Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `sp` pointer is being dereferenced at line 6 without first checking if it is NULL. The `sp` pointer is obtained from the `sctp_sk` function at line 5, but there is no guarantee that this function will always return a valid non-NULL pointer. If `sctp_sk` returns a NULL pointer, dereferencing `sp` at line 6 will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
