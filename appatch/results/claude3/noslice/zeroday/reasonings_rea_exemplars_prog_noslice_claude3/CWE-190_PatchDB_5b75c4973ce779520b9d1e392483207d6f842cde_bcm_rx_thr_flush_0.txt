Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability exists in the code because the variable `i` is declared as an `int` type, which is a signed integer type. If the value of `op->nframes` is a large positive value, the loop counter `i` may overflow during the loop iterations, leading to undefined behavior or potential security vulnerabilities.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use an unsigned integer type for the loop counter variable `i`, such as `unsigned int` or `size_t`, to prevent integer overflows when dealing with large values of `op->nframes`.
