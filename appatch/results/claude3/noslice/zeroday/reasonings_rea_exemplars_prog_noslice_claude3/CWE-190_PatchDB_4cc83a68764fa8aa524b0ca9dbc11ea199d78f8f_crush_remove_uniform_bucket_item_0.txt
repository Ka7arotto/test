Root Cause Analysis: The vulnerability CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) exists in the code because the variables `i` and `j` are declared as `int` types, which are signed integers. In certain scenarios, if the value of `bucket->h.size` is a large positive number, the loop iterations involving `i` and `j` may cause an integer overflow, leading to undefined behavior or potential security vulnerabilities.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use an unsigned integer type (e.g., `unsigned int`) for loop counters or variables that represent sizes or indices, as these variables are expected to hold only non-negative values.
