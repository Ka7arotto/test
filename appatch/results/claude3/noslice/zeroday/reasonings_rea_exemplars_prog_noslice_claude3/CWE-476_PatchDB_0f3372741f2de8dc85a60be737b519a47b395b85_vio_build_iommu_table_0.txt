Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `tbl` pointer is being dereferenced at line 16 without being checked for NULL. If the `kmalloc` call at line 15 fails and returns NULL, dereferencing `tbl` to access its members will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.
