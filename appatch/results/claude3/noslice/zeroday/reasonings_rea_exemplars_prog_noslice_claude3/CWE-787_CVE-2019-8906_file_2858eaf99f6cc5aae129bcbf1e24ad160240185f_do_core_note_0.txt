Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `memcpy` function is used to copy `descsz` bytes from `nbuf + doff` to the `pi` structure, but there is no check to ensure that `descsz` is not larger than the size of the `pi` structure. If `descsz` is larger than the size of `pi`, it can lead to a buffer overflow, where data is written beyond the bounds of the `pi` structure, resulting in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
