The given code snippet does not seem to have a CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability. The code is performing a `memcpy` operation to copy data from one structure to another, but it is not allocating any dynamic memory that needs to be released.

The CWE-401 vulnerability typically occurs when dynamically allocated memory is not properly freed or released after its intended use, leading to memory leaks. However, in the provided code, there is no dynamic memory allocation or deallocation happening.

Unless there is additional context or information missing, the code snippet itself does not exhibit a CWE-401 vulnerability based on the provided information.
