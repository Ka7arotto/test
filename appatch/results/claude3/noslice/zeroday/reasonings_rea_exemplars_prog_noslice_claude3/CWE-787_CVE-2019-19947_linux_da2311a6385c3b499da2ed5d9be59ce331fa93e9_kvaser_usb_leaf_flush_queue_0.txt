Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for `cmd` without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, `cmd` will be a null pointer, and dereferencing it later in the code (e.g., at lines 10-13) can lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, which is CWE-787.
