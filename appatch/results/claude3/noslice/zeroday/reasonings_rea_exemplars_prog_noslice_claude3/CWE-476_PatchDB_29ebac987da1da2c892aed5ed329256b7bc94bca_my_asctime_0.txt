Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) vulnerability exists in the code because the `tm` pointer is being passed to the `asctime` function without being checked for NULL. If `tm` is NULL, the `asctime(tm)` call will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior.

The root cause is the lack of a NULL check on the `tm` pointer before calling `asctime(tm)`. The `localtime` function can return NULL in certain error conditions, and if that happens, passing the NULL pointer to `asctime` will trigger the CWE-476 vulnerability.
