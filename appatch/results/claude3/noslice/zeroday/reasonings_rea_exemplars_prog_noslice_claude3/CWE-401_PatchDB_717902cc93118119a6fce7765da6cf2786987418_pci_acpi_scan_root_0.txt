Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) vulnerability exists in the code because the memory allocated for `ri` (at line 7) and `root_ops` (at line 12) using `kzalloc_node` is not being freed before returning `NULL` at line 15. This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory is not released after its effective lifetime.
