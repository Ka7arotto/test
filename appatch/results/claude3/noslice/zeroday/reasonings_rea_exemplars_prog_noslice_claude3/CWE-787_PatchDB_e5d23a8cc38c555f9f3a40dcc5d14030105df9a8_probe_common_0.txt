Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `virtrng_info` structure is not initialized after being allocated with `kmalloc`. This means that the members of the `virtrng_info` structure, such as `hwrng.name`, may contain uninitialized values, which can lead to writing beyond the allocated memory boundaries when these members are accessed or modified later in the code.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `virtrng_info` structure should be properly initialized after allocation, either by explicitly initializing its members or by using a memory zeroing function like `memset` to ensure that all members are set to a known safe state before being used.
