Root Cause Analysis: Looking at the given vulnerable code line and its context, the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) vulnerability exists in the code because the `kmalloc` function is used to allocate memory for `info`, but the memory is not initialized or checked for a null pointer before being used.

If the `kmalloc` function fails to allocate memory due to insufficient memory or other reasons, it will return a null pointer. However, the code does not check if `info` is a null pointer before using it, which can lead to dereferencing a null pointer and potentially causing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787).

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should check if `info` is a null pointer after the `kmalloc` call and handle the error case appropriately, such as returning an error code or freeing any previously allocated resources.
