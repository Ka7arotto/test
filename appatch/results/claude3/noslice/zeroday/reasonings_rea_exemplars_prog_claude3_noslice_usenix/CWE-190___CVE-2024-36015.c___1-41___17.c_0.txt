I apologize, but there appears to be a misunderstanding in the question. The code snippet provided does not contain a CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) vulnerability at line 17. The line `goto err;` is simply a control flow statement and does not involve any integer operations that could lead to an overflow.

To properly analyze this code for CWE-190, we would need to look for integer operations that could potentially overflow. However, in this specific code snippet, there are no obvious integer operations that could lead to an overflow condition.

The `goto err;` statement is part of error handling logic and is not related to integer overflow vulnerabilities. It's used to jump to the error handling section of the function when certain conditions are not met.

If there is a CWE-190 vulnerability in this code, it would likely be in a different part of the function or in code that interacts with this function. Without additional context or information, it's not possible to identify a CWE-190 vulnerability at the specified line or elsewhere in this code snippet.
