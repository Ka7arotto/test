I apologize, but there appears to be a misunderstanding in the question. The line you've highlighted:

```
31 	args.ignore_crossmnt = (ignore_crossmnt != 0);
```

does not exhibit a CWE-401  vulnerability. This line is simply assigning a boolean value to the `ignore_crossmnt` field of the `args` structure based on whether the `ignore_crossmnt` parameter is non-zero.

A  vulnerability typically occurs when a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed. This line of code doesn't involve any pointer manipulation or memory deallocation.

To properly analyze a CWE-401 vulnerability, we would need to see code that:

1. Allocates memory
2. Frees that memory
3. Attempts to use the freed memory

The given code snippet doesn't show these operations for the `args` structure or the `ignore_crossmnt` variable.

If there is indeed a CWE-401 vulnerability in this code, it would likely be in a different part of the function or in code that interacts with this function. We would need more context or a different code snippet to accurately analyze a  vulnerability.
