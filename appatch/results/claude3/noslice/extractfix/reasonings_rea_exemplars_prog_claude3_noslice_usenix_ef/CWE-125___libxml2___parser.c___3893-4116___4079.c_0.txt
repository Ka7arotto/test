Let's analyze the code step by step to understand the CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) vulnerability:

1. Input handling:
   - The function takes input parameters `ctxt`, `attlen`, and `normalize`.
   - It parses an attribute value enclosed in quotes (either ' or ").

2. Buffer allocation:
   - A buffer `buf` is allocated with an initial size of `XML_PARSER_BUFFER_SIZE`.
   - The `len` variable keeps track of the current length of the content in `buf`.

3. Main parsing loop:
   - The function reads characters and processes them, handling entities and special characters.
   - The buffer is grown as needed using `growBuffer()`.

4. Loop termination:
   - The loop ends when it encounters the closing quote, '<', or EOF.

5. Post-processing:
   - After the main loop, there's a check for trailing spaces if normalization is required:
     ```c
     if ((in_space) && (normalize)) {
         while (buf[len - 1] == 0x20) len--;
     }
     ```

6. Vulnerability:
   - The vulnerability occurs in the while loop at line 187.
   - It attempts to remove trailing spaces by decrementing `len` for each space found.

7. Root cause:
   - There's no check to ensure that `len` is greater than 0 before the subtraction.
   - If `len` becomes 0 and another space is found, `len - 1` will underflow, becoming a large positive value.
   - This large value is then used to access `buf`, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.

8. Potential consequences:
   - Reading memory outside the allocated buffer.
   - Accessing potentially sensitive information from adjacent memory.
   - Possible program crash if accessing an unmapped memory region.

9. Conditions for vulnerability:
   - The attribute value must be empty or contain only spaces.
   - The `normalize` parameter must be true.
   - The `in_space` flag must be set.

To fix this vulnerability, a check should be added to ensure `len` is greater than 0 before performing the subtraction:

```c
if ((in_space) && (normalize)) {
    while (len > 0 && buf[len - 1] == 0x20) len--;
}
```

This vulnerability demonstrates the importance of bounds checking, especially when dealing with user-supplied input or when modifying index variables that are used for array access.
