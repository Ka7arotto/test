Step 1: 
Q: Based on the given code snippet and the vulnerability mentioned, could you please provide a list of potential ways to mitigate it?

A: Mitigating the issue requires multiple steps and the specific mitigation method depends on the nature of the vulnerability and its impact. Here are some strategies that can be used to address the vulnerability:

1. Validate Inputs: Ensure that any input parameters used in the function are validated before being processed. This can help prevent malicious inputs from causing vulnerabilities.
2. Check for Null Pointers: Make sure that the page pointer is not null before attempting to free it. If it is, return an error or handle it appropriately.
3. Implement Exception Handling: Use exception handling mechanisms to catch and respond to errors. This can help prevent program termination due to unhandled exceptions.
4. Use Pointer Validation: Check that the pointer being used for memory operations is not null before attempting to access it. If it is, return an error or handle it appropriately.
5. Use Locking Mechanisms: Implement locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety. this can help prevent race conditions and data corruption.
