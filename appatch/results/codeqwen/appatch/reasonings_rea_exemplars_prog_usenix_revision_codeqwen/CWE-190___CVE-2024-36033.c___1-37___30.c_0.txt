A vulnerability has been detected among CWEs CWE-190 and among lines 71 to 78. The vulnerabilities are related to integer overflow in the given code snippet.

The vulnerability arises from the use of `le32_to_cpu(ver.soc_id)`. This function converts a little-endian unsigned 32-bit integer to a native representation, which can cause an integer overflow if the value exceeds the limit of the target data type.

The CWE-190 vulnerability refers to an integer overflow where the result of adding two or more integers with unspecified signedness results in a wrap around. In this case, the resulting value may exceed the maximum valid 32-bit integer value, leading to unintended behavior or errors in the program.

To address the CWE-190 vulnerability, it is recommended to ensure that the input values are properly validated and constrained before being used in calculations. Additionally, using a safer data type or ensuring proper handling of overflows could be a viable approach.
