Given the code slice, it appears to be a static inline function `DecodeBase64Block`. The vulnerability in this code snippet is CWE-787 (Out-of-bound write) at the line:

```
Ascii[0] = (uint8_t) (b64[0] << 2) | (b64[1] >> 4);
```

This line of code writes to the first element of the `Ascii` array, which has a fixed size. The value being written is derived from the bitwise operations on elements of the `b64` array. However, there's no explicit check to ensure that the length of the `b64` array is at least 2 before accessing its second element.

### Conclusion:
The vulnerability in this code snippet occurs because the function does not validate the input array lengths appropriately. By directly accessing elements of the input arrays without bounds checking, it may lead to writing past the end of the allocated memory, which could result in corruption and potential security vulnerabilities. Adding proper input validation checks for the size of `b64` is essential to prevent this type of buffer overflow vulnerability.
